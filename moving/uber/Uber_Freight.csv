2023-10-21 22:27:13,5,Great
2023-10-19 06:54:46,5,Excelente
2023-10-18 19:05:26,1,They don't pay you for some loads and they play you. I wrote this review 9/2022 it's Oct/ 2023 they still leave you high and dry. Cancel on them they give you bad score cancel on you they just tell you to figure it out. Convoy and Uber are the same company just has 2 different names don't understand why...
2023-10-17 19:12:34,3,"Support is overseas and totally useless! You can't speak with the real broker. Very disappointed. You ruined really good project by yourself. When you call the support you can hear dogs barking on the background, chickens, noise of power tool cutting metal etc. Really?"
2023-10-17 17:16:50,5,Very good!!
2023-10-16 21:08:01,5,Nice app to move freight
2023-10-16 01:17:31,1,"Uber Freight and Powerloop is trash now. They charge now for late return of the trailer and now will not allow you to use it for a back haul. Also, they will continuously hound you for status at every stop and/or during transit. And on top of that, they are slow to pay. Back to getting a factoring company and ditching Uber Freight."
2023-10-11 23:59:52,5,Very good
2023-10-08 17:08:38,4,"Rates could be better, but this is single handedly, and by far, the best app available for dispatch. You're able to see detailed location information, reviews from drivers, satellite images, and easily find more loads in areas you are going to."
2023-10-04 05:30:47,1,Horrible carrier support. Everything is done in the app. You submit a ticket in the app and they contact you. They will refuse too properly compensate for mistakes they make on their end. I recommend only booking loads with Uber Freight if you're in a pinch and there is nothing else.
2023-10-03 15:14:35,5,"Been always happy with Uber, We just hope they could work a little bit on the RATE."
2023-09-15 16:33:39,5,Good loads and rates
2023-09-14 20:24:26,1,Do not let them use you until they monopolize this industry and kill the freight market!
2023-09-07 20:42:56,5,"Best part is that it's free I pay For DAT, Truck Stop and 123 load board."
2023-08-31 04:21:43,5,Great Experience
2023-08-28 18:46:52,5,Has is ups and downs but mostly from the client part. Guess if the warehouse don't have the loads ready is nobody's fault but theirs... Thanks Uber
2023-08-24 21:11:43,5,Extremely user friendly it's a great service.
2023-08-23 14:17:41,5,Great comparative loads
2023-08-22 00:45:45,5,I like it.
2023-08-16 04:56:26,2,"This app just turned terrible again, it doesn't remember your search selection van, refer, weight extra, it also doesn't show you your BOL once you send it for your payment, especially in spotty signal areas, because of that it only uploaded one picture not all pages, yet doesn't let you see what the main office is seeing and why they rejected the picture in the first place... Need to fix these issues, would be happier if someone could resolve this problem so I can continue to work ... Grrrrrrr"
2023-08-13 04:58:07,1,Be careful moving loads here watch rewiews of shipper & receivers stop the steal Uber is not paying nothing when they are taking forever to get you loaded or unloaded
2023-08-12 04:21:06,5,I have not used it yet but because a lot of my friends told me that this app is really good.
2023-08-10 12:55:33,5,Just what a Truck Driver need!
2023-08-10 01:44:25,1,Very unhappy trying to confirm with carrier can't log in.
2023-08-09 23:01:35,4,Decent
2023-08-04 01:57:50,1,"Uber freight is straight trash. They are in the business of destroying owner-operators with their cheap rates. All they do is rip off truck drivers. I'm tired of calling them, and I hear chickens in the background."
2023-07-31 23:33:48,5,Practical!!!
2023-07-28 23:42:37,2,No flatbed work
2023-07-24 23:24:36,5,Hey! Is there any job or delivery an 18 years old can participate on uber? thanks uber you're the best.
2023-07-22 06:05:14,1,"In this business of trucking, Time is important, we as truck driver O/O we don't afford to lose time. The most problem i have is when I call uber regard an issue they have to escalate it to someone else and it can/mostly take hours before the situation resolved witch often will costs me to lose thousands of dollars because I have to cancel future loads due to delay responses. Also I had issues with Uber not wanting to pay me detention when it clearly recorded in/out time on their system and BOL"
2023-07-20 12:29:37,1,"Bee careful the like playing with tracking,at the and the wont pay"
2023-07-18 03:40:16,5,Very easy to use and support team is always there to help. Great people.
2023-07-08 13:03:19,1,I keep installing and uninstalling and can't get the app to open or work ?
2023-07-08 00:15:42,1,Stay away! They haven't paid me for a load I did in December last year and they keep giving me the runaround! Avoid them at all costs. I stopped working with them since February of this year (2023)
2023-07-04 15:17:42,1,Uber will refuse you TONU based on the lies from the shipper. And will be reporting them to the FMCSA and DOT
2023-06-27 21:21:29,2,It's probably just me but this loadboard is complicated. I see a 100 loads and 64 reloads but no button to push to take load. When I hit the support button it takes me to the last load I did 6/8 and ask if that's what I need help with. No options for any OTHER help.ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2023-06-24 00:32:31,5,"Its super smart and easy to book loads with a second through uber freight app,"
2023-06-23 11:44:51,5,"Easy to use, lots of choices"
2023-06-20 14:39:51,1,Horrible
2023-05-30 20:02:37,5,Very Good
2023-05-29 13:43:05,5,"Easy book no lies,thanks uber."
2023-05-21 13:04:19,5,Great
2023-05-20 16:06:10,1,junk
2023-05-14 22:42:21,1,Hate that you leave out Cargo vans on your app.
2023-05-11 00:37:03,1,This app is useless. And the loads are cheap. Also this company does illegal tactics and then suspends you for a week at a time because you don't play along with their illegal tactics. It is illegal to call drivers while they're off duty. One wreck cause you wake up a sleeping driver and Uber will be out of business after the lawsuit. And when they call and wake you up the person on the other end doesn't even know English. The app will show rates going up 2 cents then start going backwards.
2023-05-03 16:23:45,1,Do not use Uber freight!! They drop the ball on everything. I sent them BOL'S and lumper receipts but they ignore them. Then they say I owe them money because I never sent them smh! Horrible!
2023-04-28 05:30:28,1,"No body use this company its worst load board ever I try it once after that I deleted the app they are not honest with money specially for detention and Lumber fee , and the loads always over weight not good load board I prefer anther load boards better than this one avoided as u can its horrible load board and not honest about money"

2023-04-24 21:22:30,5,"Well just got updated the app but its crushing, on android phone. Looking for loads but all of sudden it closes away, crashes too often plus we need direct accounting number or email address to contact also when PODS rejected should be a note with reasons why its been rejected."
2023-04-19 17:03:23,1,"I downloaded this app so I could ask a question, sorry. I was wondering, cos it's Uber, are the loads strictly for 18-wheelers or can a pickup be used?"
2023-04-19 13:28:41,5,Great app
2023-04-16 18:44:45,1,Don't waist your time they have so cheap loads üëéüëéüëé
2023-04-14 20:42:20,1,Was having some technical difficulty with their app. Called 5 times to get help. Every time representative said they submitted my offer for me and to be watching for an email about my offer. NOTHING. Every time they were going to put as urgent to push it through faster. Still nothing. Now after 6 to 7 hours of dealing with this the load disappeared
2023-04-14 15:22:38,5,Factoring services??
2023-04-08 04:24:27,1,The uber broker is very cheap i never seen broker add 10 dolar on load when make bidding cheap cheap hungry money take 40 to 60 % on load and never full hungry money
2023-03-29 16:10:16,1,"Apparently people in this country can't read fuel prices or do basic math. I see $4.53 per gallon and we get around 5 miles per gallon. So that's about .95 cents per mile. Which does NOT include insurance, maintenance, taxes or contracts. So if your paying $1.25 per mile and it costs .95 cents a mile to move we only have .30 cents per mile for maintenance, insurance, taxes and contracts."
2023-03-20 11:02:56,1,No long needed
2023-03-16 20:23:58,1,Not friendly to use won't let you apply information
2023-03-15 14:22:10,1,It don't keep tracking it don't stay linked
2023-03-10 05:43:46,1,"Very cheap freights and heavy loads, maintenance, fuel and insurance are so expensive. DON'T TAKE CHEAP FREIGHTS."
2023-03-05 17:04:11,5,Nice application very easy to find it loads and quickly get pay
2023-03-01 02:51:05,5,"I love the fact got aasked for my opinion simply because this is an amazing travel app and easy to use for you, yourself, as well as a travel car app to use amonsgt family, especially if you have smaller babies (kids) or bigger or elderly children or should i say pre-teens. Lol, literally i love using this app. Its fast cheap, convenient and easy for me and my family as well as their kids and their friends and so-on-so-on. Thanks for being of great use and services to me & my close family & ETC."

2023-02-22 09:32:47,1,Cheap loads. They Never accept bids
2023-02-21 06:03:15,1,I can never get the app to load. Keep saying error and I get a black screen
2023-02-20 14:59:20,2,Rates yo low
2023-02-15 15:26:47,5,Simple to use
2023-02-14 12:58:55,1,Over20 hrs can't login in u can't fix so losing monies this app is no good
2023-02-13 17:14:35,5,Great experience
2023-02-09 00:29:03,1,You had one of the best apps and ypu had to change it. The new interface is terrible. It gets stuck with loading loads and i have to restart the app. Bring me back the old app
2023-02-05 10:04:36,4,Very good
2023-02-02 19:00:49,2,"Latest update isn't showing any loads. Search preferences reset after an hour. Clearing system cache fixes the issue sometimes, and other times, multiple cache clearing is required for a temporary fix. Problems most often happen after phone reboot."
2023-02-01 22:49:26,5,"Easy booking, bidding allowed."
2023-02-01 06:52:28,5,"Experience has been good so far. Easy to communicate with and even though I have voiced some opinions they still works with me. Overall I'm good with working with Uber Freight. I apologize, I didn't know this feedback was for Google. I thought this was one of the monthly feedbacks they usually send. But we got it done. Furthermore, I have had issues before and they worked with me on any of my issues. I have a good relationship with Uber Freight. I really don't have any complaints."
2023-01-28 05:06:10,5,The support people are very understanding and will help with any and every problem you come across dealing with uber freight and they pay out with no hesitations best load board sofar
2023-01-27 23:28:38,1,"App is buggy, cannot even log in even though regular uber account works fine."
2023-01-23 17:45:42,1,"If you don't want Uber to take your money, avoid driving for them. They keep withholding carrier funds, request logs in any order to pay the carrier layover, and ask for additional BOL papers that are nonexistent in order to avoid paying the carrier. I have a feeling they are on the verge of bankruptcy. Continue driving for this carrier if you want to get stolen. That's the last time I haul a cargo for them."
2023-01-18 20:27:38,1,Literally can do nothing on the app. I sign in and it says there's an error. Done this one multiple devices with the same result.
2023-01-16 14:31:06,5,Nice app to find your load
2023-01-15 06:58:36,2,"Damn low rates. You can get better rates on the loadboard. Only good thing about this is the ease of use. I used Uber freight 30% of the time as i am a new owner operator and most brokers require 1-3 months of authority. I had a problem yesterday where i had to stay at the shipper waiting for Uber to give me a response on a pickup number. In the end, load was cancelled and i was offered a miserable $150 TONU for 20 hours of waiting. Im Stuck here for the weekend so i asked for more. Regret This"
2023-01-13 23:03:32,5,User friendly everything you need is in the app
2023-01-12 07:52:59,1,Awful
2023-01-11 00:50:45,2,The new app is horrible cluster . Its confusing to read . Just back to the app that's was 2 yrs ago.
2023-01-07 23:37:12,3,3 stars because my app works most of the time but when it start messing up I have to close the app & reopen it. I like hauling for uber freight but the most problem is the rates are so low & fuel is so high if you have a repair issue you just worked a free load. Trucking is starting to really go down hill because of these brokers rates. We keep the world feed & comfortable & stable and barely able to keep to feed ourselves. We are away from our families and still can't afford to live comfortable
2023-01-06 11:26:42,1,Heavy load and Cheap
2023-01-04 20:31:51,5,Pretty easy to use it. Excellent customer service.
2023-01-04 14:36:59,1,"BAD , THEY have very incompetent people working. WASTE of time energies"
2023-01-03 16:27:08,5,Love it!
2022-12-18 15:23:21,1,"Transplace merger made uber freight horrible to work with. Since the merger thr rates are super low, payment is slow now, and less loads. They expect for you to sir on loads for days at a time. Bae merge with trashplace."
2022-12-17 22:28:28,5,Great app for truck drivers
2022-12-17 03:32:48,5,Awesome
2022-12-16 23:33:56,4,it nicet to have
2022-12-12 14:49:53,5,Easy to book the loads and make money
2022-12-10 06:21:51,1,You never speak to the same person twice and there is always a language barrier when you do speak to someone. Not to mention 4-5 calls a day for a status update when they are tracking you! The app/loads are ok sometimes but the service is complete trash.
2022-12-09 01:42:27,5,Good üëç
2022-12-07 22:58:39,5,Nice
2022-11-25 01:14:50,1,"Things are changing within Uber Freight! Today 11/24/22 I got stuck in the middle of KY, due to Uber canceling the load. They didn't even call me. When I called their agent, she said that she will send a request to see if the account manager will CONSIDER compensating me for my already wasted time and money, not to mention the lost of family time (Thanksgiving) . Now I have to drive empty 215mi.($) to fulfill my responsibilities with my other customers. I'm extremely disappointed, please fix!"
2022-11-24 02:11:38,5,Very easy to use.
2022-11-21 13:46:26,5,Allow everything good uber Freight good service üëå I need help need more loads.
2022-11-18 21:32:29,5,Amazing
2022-11-13 15:17:46,1,Took app off after trying to create account never. I was never able to use.
2022-11-07 11:50:55,1,Uber drivers are drug dealers now... Great!
2022-11-03 10:57:44,5,"On offer they give less bid option thats only thing,All in all great üëç"
2022-10-27 02:28:08,5,Very fast
2022-10-24 13:28:57,5,Excellent
2022-10-19 14:28:44,5,Better rates then most brokers.
2022-10-17 14:51:47,5,Best load board app
2022-10-15 20:38:35,5,Professional team
2022-10-15 02:35:11,5,Best team üíô
2022-10-11 22:11:11,2,The app works good but they are just like everybody else when he comes down to payments and detention times and compensation they won't pay up but half the time and if they do they always short you
2022-10-09 13:17:33,4,Great customer service
2022-10-08 00:37:46,5,Super easy to book a load! Love it so far!
2022-10-05 04:39:15,5,Easy to navigate
2022-10-04 17:21:06,5,Great
2022-10-03 04:43:44,5,stay away from this app. you're not going to make any money. Pay per load is unbelievably low. You're better off looking for a broker. even the worst broker pays the best price for loads.
2022-09-28 21:59:01,1,"Very Cheap freight. The service from the foreign people are very bad. Rates constantly being cut on good loads that pay them well. They will under cut other brokers and carriers to screw them. I haul a $1100 load from another broker and the exact same load they have at $735, absolutely a very bad company."
2022-09-22 21:10:58,1,"After SIX two factor authentications to get logged in, y'all thought it was a good idea to ask me how my experience with the app is. Ratings begging is the worst kind of ego stroking, so I hope this one star rating is an appropriate middle finger."
2022-09-08 02:33:24,1,"Bad- the pay is not sufficient to the work, the pay needs to be increased No muevan est√°s cargas baratas esta gente piensan q nos estamos muriendo de anbre 9/7/22"
2022-09-05 15:12:01,5,Awesome app and experience
2022-09-04 00:24:55,5,Good so far
2022-08-30 11:05:37,2,When there are no issues it's fine..... but when problems arise customer service and problem solving are pretty much nonexistent... you will be waiting for hours and they still will have not resolved issues

2022-08-23 12:22:19,4,It's been good operating with great and help me when you in a crisis

2022-08-17 13:33:43,5,App is user friendly but not too many options to negotiate. I've done same load that is posted for different rate but I can't ask anyone if they'll do it for that same rate. Just have to keep watching rate go up and down until someone takes it
2022-08-16 17:59:28,4,"For every update, I loose an option that is crucial to me, forcing me to have to call Uber, just for them to tell me that I can do it on the app. Run trials on the app before releasing them, not everything works... UPDATE: Uber fixed the issue of not being able to cancel loads with V2.85. thanks."
2022-08-13 12:55:36,1,No Google suck
2022-08-08 20:57:12,5,Helpful always answers phone regardless of wethe I understand them or not they answers and try to resolve the issue.
2022-08-08 00:32:30,2,Never open on time
2022-08-04 21:48:41,3,3 1/2 üåü. There tracking system is the horriblest ever. Must call threw hole load. Put load back. It has load done when your not even finish with pick up. Fix gps tracking system. It's been longer then a year with problem. Enough.
2022-08-04 18:38:31,1,Unreasonable and a violation of civil rights
2022-07-26 14:06:40,4,"Uber Freight has improved since i wrote my last 3 stars review, now i can give them 4 stars.i am still nervous when i book a load with uber bcz their cancelation rate was very high compared to ch or jb hunt. Customer support is 5 stars and detention is also okay. As for now uber is paying more than others, u just need to gamble as when is the right time to book bcz they will add some money as the load approaches pick up timeüëçüëçüëçüëç the app is working perfect for me, never had a problem."
2022-07-24 22:01:25,5,Uber freight is an awesome load carrier. You receive your funds as stated. Just need to increase the rates a lil more.
2022-07-18 12:39:21,5,Great freight rates. And on time payments weekly
2022-07-18 05:19:15,1,"Quite and cool,"
2022-07-15 12:08:22,4,"Finding, booking and speaking with customer service are all great only issue I have with this loadboard is the rates go up and down. A load would be posted at 9 a.m by 9:30 the same load would drop between 20 and 100 dollars. I asked Uber about this and they tell me is that's how the algorithm works üòíüòí"
2022-07-13 07:05:40,5,great site
2022-07-12 16:34:26,5,Exelente app facil para buscar cargas Nice
2022-07-08 02:01:14,1,Uber freight used to be one of my go to brokers. Lately they seem just as bad as TQL. The brokers seem to do whatever they want now. And there is no way of getting in contact with anyone who can actually fix anything. All the people answering the phones are basically secretary they take a message and pass it along to someone else who doesn't want to fix the problem. Uber used to be pretty decent and good to work with. I guess the greed has take over.
2022-07-04 21:36:52,1,"They manipulate rate on based what u pickup last. My friend share load with me for $3300 and when I open that load only shows me $2740 bcz I have RATE ON FILE(with different lane but they think I can take all load for 2700 lol) when I call Them to remove rate on file & they said someone will contact me, never heard from Them. Never haul load since that day. They r cheapest Paying broker ever. I ask my friend what u pay for ship he Said $6k &Uber pays me $1130 & Uberfreight ripping off everyone"
2022-06-28 04:11:43,5,0$√†
2022-06-27 11:24:38,5,Finally got in and it is awesome!
2022-06-24 14:17:19,5,Great Application.
2022-06-23 23:17:38,1,Accessing the app has been a nightmare
2022-06-23 15:26:44,1,When I put in my information to sign up all it say is loading & be stuck saying that for hrs
2022-06-22 21:50:31,5,We love working with Uber Freight
2022-06-22 18:49:22,1,"Owner operator, be careful with this people, they don't pay at all... I did a run for the. 5 weeks ago, never told me I have to update bank account to get pay, 1 week later I update the Information with the bank account Information and as right now 5 weeks and half and still don't have received my money on the bank... I called them again today and they say they don't haven't update the information. This is really bad experience with Uber Freight I belive I won't NEVER WORK WITH THEM AGAIN¬∞¬∞!!"
2022-06-21 20:15:12,1,"Bare minimum pay. Flaming hoops to jump through for detention, etc. Very few options for contact, etc., within the app. Uber doesn't understand trucking. They only understand their own bottom line. WHERE'S MY TONU, YOU PIECES OF GARBAGE?"
2022-06-20 02:48:56,5,Good company!
2022-06-12 19:12:17,5,Very good for work
2022-06-12 18:32:30,1,"Absolutely horrible. Doesn't load at all. Just sort with ""Loading..."" displayed. I literally plugged my phone in to keep charge and over an hour later it said the same thing. No change. If I got a load on here as often as I get unwanted automated spam emails, I'd be rich."
2022-06-05 05:43:55,1,Sucks spam and fraud
2022-06-03 15:12:18,1,"Uber is the only one that's keeping us working with dedicated loads. However when they mess up they don't compensate the driver & they take weeks to pay you for thier mistake. I've been waiting to get paid for a load that we delivered May 27, 2022 They don't want to pay us for redelivery either. I'm so upset with them !!"
2022-06-03 00:03:20,5,1st load and I'm loving the selections!!!
2022-06-01 10:57:43,1,No working
2022-05-28 13:27:29,5,It looks like it's easy
2022-05-24 20:20:34,5,Good
2022-05-17 23:43:18,1,Doing market research to see what load boards I'm going to use... the ones that don't let me see anything without coughing up info first are eliminated. ‚úå
2022-05-17 18:16:26,1,"Updating old review on:05/17/2022 Extremely low rates, you guys donts have trucks but we do . FYI diesel is $6.55/gallon nationwide and your rates are stil $1.80 rpm 2.00 RPM . we truckers truly think and believe you ""UberFreight "" is making money and we're wasting our time and money by running your loads. stop RIPPING US off."
2022-05-17 00:22:22,1,Trash. just as other uber apps....
2022-05-16 14:05:41,2,Not tha great
2022-05-13 20:40:32,5,Easy to use
2022-05-12 13:08:11,5,Rates could be better. More loads in and out of Tn.
2022-05-11 23:46:00,5,Pretty fast book a load with one click
2022-05-11 20:39:22,5,Good dadicated lane
2022-05-11 18:13:27,4,Its good
2022-05-09 12:15:14,1,"Their bidding process is stupid. You can't bid automatically through the app on all the loads, and when you call to bid their reps give you lip about your offer. Also they never have a manager to speak to. One rep told me they have no manager and they can do whatever the hell they want. DON'T HAUL ANY FREIGHT FOR THESE AHOLES. UBER FREIGHT IS NOTHING MORE THAN A PREDATORY BROKER WITH USELESS REPS THAT CAN ONLY TAKE NOTES"
2022-04-28 23:26:58,5,Easiest app to me to navigate
2022-04-27 01:18:12,1,Trash all together hire folks that's can make decisions and fix issues and stop THIS GARBAGE AUTOMATED TRASH
2022-04-25 20:10:24,1,"Uber tries to be nice, but they are not honest to the reviews on facilities and giving the exact name of the comapny from time to time, especially if the company has a bad reputation and they know you wont get the load and they will cheat you. 2nd, their costumer service is horrible....even though they pay pennies to Indian workers overseas....."
2022-04-23 01:12:11,2,It has been over a month to get my payment for a delivery waiting for a manager to approve it. And no answer yet. Even though everything is good to go paper wise. Be prepared to deal with stuff like this. On the regular basis. When u call to get things resolved it will take time. Update * after sending my load number to the email . The situation got resolved the next day. Thank you for the fast help
2022-04-22 13:33:29,5,The best application
2022-04-22 05:39:02,1,"Cheap rate.. horrible experience with customer service when you have an issue within a load. And keep you on the load for a long period till the issue is resolved.. no communication, have to keep calling to resolved any issue but they call you constantly to find where you are when they can track you on the app. To many issues to describe. To me personally not worth it."
2022-04-21 22:45:04,5,Great
2022-04-17 11:43:57,2,uber used be a good app to find loads now the rates are terrible and they drop longer the load is up which makes no sense
2022-04-16 02:21:43,1,"Stop calling so much, it's unnecessary, that's why the location app is on the phone... Unless the driver reports a issue then there's no need to call him... And get some people in there that can speak good English..."
2022-04-15 04:48:49,5,Just keep getting better with each update
2022-04-14 23:33:31,5,How do I get this installed on my PC?
2022-04-07 19:42:59,1,Your app is bad it keeps trying to make me a separate carrier other than the company I work for I can't get in it can't get help can't get my load information it sucks
2022-04-07 13:27:12,2,"Flash does not work, camera is off center and appears zoomed in while taking the photo."
2022-04-06 20:38:15,1,Where's the freight. Only a couple of load's show..
2022-04-04 04:55:50,2,"I enjoy using the app. The only problem(s) I have with the app are when it has bundle loads and one of the loads states bidding available, there is no way to bid on the load-it is either take the load for what they have or go find each load in the single run, bid and then book each one hoping that they are all still there. Then you can't negotiate, once they counter, it's take it ot leave it. FIX those issues to start and it would be a little more decent."
2022-04-01 18:32:27,4,I enjoyed when we could bid for the load
2022-03-31 21:19:15,1,"They never answer the phone, zero stars if possible"
2022-03-31 03:46:07,5,AI sometimes better than being on hold or being at a pay phone on the side of the road
2022-03-29 21:55:38,4,Great app
2022-03-28 22:33:28,1,"I am new to Uber freight looking through the load board And I can't find anything over a $1.80 a mile üòÆ How do you guys that is pulling Uber freight survive off these rates? I drive conservatively I average 8 miles per gallon, and the price of fuel alone will put me under a dollar a mile profit. That's not counting truck payments, Insurance, maintenance Permits And then you have to add in your own personal life expenses How are you guys surviving.....ü§îü§îü§î So far this app is unusable for me"
2022-03-26 23:40:32,1,Can't post anything the app wants to restart and ask for information all over again
2022-03-25 16:22:09,5,"I am very satisfied with Uber, especially Thomas he really makes sure you are happy with the app."
2022-03-23 21:29:34,5,I like it üëå
2022-03-22 23:30:11,5,Good
2022-03-21 22:11:51,5,Awesome Load Board App!
2022-03-21 06:35:49,5,Easy to navigate. Great for Carriers.
2022-03-20 13:05:24,5,Just like to work with us!!
2022-03-19 16:16:40,1,Very cheap
2022-03-19 00:22:12,1,Poor support
2022-03-14 17:57:11,1,Muchos problemas estan bien atrasados. Entregamos la renovaci√≥n del nuevo seguro hase un mes y todavia lo estan mirando y la app no est√° disponible
2022-03-11 08:33:08,1,Still incredibly unreliable and terrible service they cancelled loads the last minute and don't communicate.. The APplooks good
2022-03-11 03:30:38,5,Very Good
2022-03-10 13:03:13,5,"My personal experience with Uber Freight have been very positive, a few issues here and there but mostly positive. I find their load board very transparent and easy to work. . They have one of the best freight board ever. üëç Thank you Uber freight."
2022-03-09 05:07:45,1,"No entiendo que est√° pasando con Uber ahora, se tardan para pagar y por cualquier excusa rechazan los BOL, luego pone uno ofertas en la app y no las contestan y no negosean y esperan que alguien m√°s se las lleve, ya no son tan profesionales."
2022-03-04 12:04:37,1,"When you booked a load with UBER. you are committing a SUICIDE YOUR SELF, from the very first moment that you have problems they take HOURS AND HOURS TO FIXED they Carrier Support is horrible you don't have access to speak with a Supervisor no that is not posible, they limit your solution just to emails, you will be lucky if you receive answers within 24 hours, they keep the Load in your trailer, you don't make money, and they don't care, BAD BAD BAD BROKER"
2022-03-03 09:51:27,4,The only issue is when it comes biding they counter you cheap and you will stuck with that counter I mean you can't bid again
2022-03-02 16:28:50,5,I'm happy to be part of this great team. Good loads and good rates working together makes us stronger üí™
2022-03-02 15:37:40,2,"I left a 1 star review earlier but they called me so I raised them by 1 star for that. But only 1 because they are lost in their sea of rules and obviously there is not a single classA CDL driver in their whole climate controlled building because they have no idea what truck driving really is. Its getting a load to a customer, we are professionals doing the real work while they quarterback, critique, and ""matrix"" us-god what a word-from their 9 to 5 comfort."
2022-03-02 13:03:26,1,"Wont pay detention, wont pay TONU, will give a negative mark on your scorecard if you have to cancel a load due to THEM providing wrong load details, if they don't pay you correctly then accept that you will never see that money because they don't care at all. Doesn't matter how many times you contact them about issues like what I mentioned, they will just say ""we'll look into it"" but never do anything because they don't care about you unless the issue has to do with getting a load delivered."
2022-02-27 13:37:03,5,Perfect to use
2022-02-25 03:09:23,5,Good app
2022-02-25 01:47:17,5,"I've had one bad experience working with this broker but i guess life is not a bed of roses either, so to be fair i feel I must shine a light on their good side as well. Better rates than most competing on the same platforms. Easy to book loads on this app. Very friendly customer service. Best for small companies just starting out with a new authority, best of luck."
2022-02-24 18:19:19,2,"User friendly platform then most load boards , customer service is pretty good although uber takes a bit long to resolve issues like wrong pick #, wrong appointment time, etc. And rates are considerably low compared to other loadboards, and will see a pattern of the rates droppong after awhile. This why for 2 stars ...... if they had better competitive rates I would give 5 stars !üåü"
2022-02-21 20:14:51,1,"Literally zero loads, and I'm in a high freight area. I didn't even add any filters. What's going on? Is Uber Freight dead?"
2022-02-21 20:08:21,5,It works üëç
2022-02-21 14:59:06,3,"Uber freight isn't bad don't bid on a load because you'll screw yourself can't counter bid , lately they don't have much for loads and the rate has dropped considerably"
2022-02-18 04:09:54,1,Well the app is great....the brokerage is the worst bunch of scabs I have ever seen....I thought chr was bad but there loads pay twice as much as this con artist....also pray you don't have a problem with a load you will be talking to someone in the Philippines that knows nothing about trucking and isn't going to solve the problem ...also get ready to play there rate game...watch and watch ...I use them when I need a fill in load but that's it...we where pulling 200 loads a quarter..now appx 40
2022-02-16 09:50:05,5,Excellent looks and function on the app alot of good load's!
2022-02-15 17:03:31,5,"The rates have been great, and the pay is quick."
2022-02-11 15:49:09,5,Good üëç
2022-02-11 12:54:51,2,"The worst rates possible. Don't bother. They might have a decent rate once in a blue moon, but other brokers are usually much higher."
2022-02-11 11:47:06,5,Great app
2022-02-11 00:59:13,5,Very good app for work

2022-02-03 15:32:15,5,Good
2022-02-02 14:41:05,5,EXTREMELY SATISFIED
2022-02-01 16:23:10,1,How can both of my emails already been taken before i even began using the app?
2022-02-01 00:10:31,5,Support is great I've got no negative thing to say.
2022-01-30 14:53:18,5,Very Satisfied
2022-01-29 02:09:09,5,Works great
2022-01-28 22:42:34,4,New.But later
2022-01-28 09:10:49,1,I do not haul Uber afraid I have a new dispatcher and he did not know that he booked me a load and after I accepted it I found out it was Uber and true to form this load is terrible two pickups two deliveries so late in the day the deliveries are so early I do not believe this load is legally possible or it will ruin your whole next day I think they have fake reviews otherwise their rating would be very low every driver I know does not like Uber freight cheapest freight ever
2022-01-26 05:28:34,5,Easy & Convenient to use .
2022-01-25 14:02:37,2,When trying to select lower delivery radius (trip lenght) in settings is still showl loads with long distance over 300 miles even when I checked that long loads setting was turned off
2022-01-24 02:16:04,5,Very good app.
2022-01-24 01:03:44,3,It would be great if there is possibility to get work for Cargo Vans
2022-01-21 13:46:37,5,The best app for truck drivers IMO. App very easy to use
2022-01-19 18:13:51,5,A little bit cheaper than some .app is kool. You know when it pic up whenit delivers wher and when and what it pays. Up front. Dont have waste time calling on a load just to find out u cant make appt. Easy to plan ur week PEACE!!
2022-01-18 21:04:26,5,Very nice representative.
2022-01-18 17:45:27,3,Need to a better job at rates period.
2022-01-14 20:18:22,3,I can't find power only loads ever since I signed up.

2022-01-09 23:56:49,1,Doesn't work.
2022-01-08 19:17:05,5,Very positive!!
2022-01-06 21:13:23,1,"The most rude and unprofessional support ever ! Please work on your so called 24/7 support ! It's a disaster, extremely bad English skills , and helpless"
2022-01-05 05:24:24,2,No power only moves in my area in Florida at all.
2022-01-04 01:36:25,5,"Very good company to work with,"
2021-12-31 17:45:47,1,"We have not been paid since 12/17/21. Not sure what's going on with them Everytime we call, we end up in a call center somewhere in Asia, where the operators will only give canned answers. We are owed for 5 loads at present. We have halted operations with Uber Freight until this is resolved."
2021-12-30 16:11:35,5,Outstanding
2021-12-23 17:08:34,5,Easy and Great app
2021-12-23 05:24:01,5,Straight.
2021-12-23 03:56:14,5,Awesome
2021-12-23 01:11:03,1,I've been on here for a month now and still can't see any load loads

2021-12-18 06:59:29,5,Great working with uber
2021-12-17 18:00:46,5,Loads up fast
2021-12-16 12:46:07,2,"The app is not providing any options for example: Can't select equipment type Can't select specific pickup date Can't select route type, weather one way, round trip, or single trip. Ect, ect."
2021-12-16 02:43:54,5,Great App
2021-12-15 16:41:01,1,"The regular driving app is horrible and these people are a bunch of clowns.... When your ready to step away from the circus, make 26' box trucks okay 2 use, do a rental program for the trucks because no one will jeopardize their insurance skyrocketing using a 3rd party. U guys want to start this so let us use your DOT Number. FYI, get better w/your phone service and customer service. Uber never responds back 2 you after they read this. I know I reported them to BBB and I made several reviews"
2021-12-15 16:00:06,1,"Fix the single load filter option... don't need round trips results which seems to be happening even after filtering Was working fine but after updates all I get is ""No loads to display"" Resetting search criteria doesn't help. No response from uber after email them."
2021-12-11 15:33:33,5,Come up with loads for TEAM DRIVING
2021-12-10 17:22:46,1,"When are you guys, going to add box truck?"
2021-12-06 13:38:42,4,I have rented penske trucks in the past for some personal use and when I had some extra time I wanted to try and use the app but it was too difficult. Is there anyway for me and others alike to use this app for rentals like that?
2021-12-05 20:36:35,1,"Its already 2 weeks since my account its not active, got email from uber freight my account its active and i can book loads but when I tried to log in is say need some information from me to activate"
2021-12-01 23:53:38,5,They pay me before I get home and rates are decent
2021-11-30 19:17:57,5,Awsome
2021-11-25 14:23:29,1,this people shouldn't even be doing business..there prices for there loads are unrealistic..and worse yet is the people that take them and do bussines with themüëéüëé
2021-11-23 21:50:41,1,"Worst company, customer service based in the Philippines and in Columbia, nobody knows what is going on ,so use at your own discretion"
2021-11-20 21:02:43,5,The best app for freight
2021-11-20 11:55:05,1,"The broker John Randel C. in this company is a liar. Booked the load for delivery at 5:30am, when he called why the company is closed, the broker quickly changed the payment at 8am, arguing that the company opens at 8 am and in fact at 6 am, and in the downloaded documents is 5:30"
2021-11-16 12:13:16,5,üëç
2021-11-14 00:36:11,5,Excellent!
2021-11-12 12:48:48,5,I love it
2021-11-11 08:07:25,2,"Dispatch doesnt get updates. Evidently because they email, call and pester drivers etc..While trying to sleep so load can be delivered safely...A pure HEADACHE"
2021-11-10 09:00:49,5,Has some really good rates.
2021-11-09 01:52:47,5,Easy to work with
2021-11-09 00:58:37,5,Easier to excess
2021-11-04 15:52:04,5,Ok
2021-10-28 05:12:29,5,It is always great to work with Uber freight
2021-10-28 01:04:27,5,Best booking / broker around.
2021-10-27 22:37:12,5,"Great support, detention is good too, easy to work with."
2021-10-25 19:34:42,4,"Good loads ,good prices,good people to work with!!!!!"
2021-10-23 18:40:08,5,Uber works well for me!
2021-10-21 19:14:58,5,Needs a fix rate for load. Don't like load price up&down.Takes too long 2 to 5 hours for solving issues at shipper or receiving. So far doing great üëç please keep up. Thank you!
2021-10-21 10:23:56,1,Trying to download the app and it tells me that I will be able to download it within 24 hrs. It's been almost two weeks and 4 tries. I can't sign up!
2021-10-20 21:18:02,5,The Best app ever!!
2021-10-17 19:02:18,5,Just great
2021-10-14 21:25:19,2,"App is easy to use without to many glitches BUT uber freight is a complete joke due to their lack of communication. Dont expect detention, or any other accessories. If uour already having issue at shipper. Leave the load and disappear. They tied up my trailer for 2 weeks so far. CARRIERS AND SHIPPERS BEWARE!!"
2021-10-14 19:57:20,5,Easy to operate.
2021-10-14 16:09:12,1,Uber freight . Very bad company.
2021-10-11 22:48:21,1,"Having trouble signing up ,"
2021-10-11 09:55:08,5,Excellent
2021-10-11 06:23:44,4,So far so good. Comes in handy as a third source for loads. I like the fact that we do not have to factor loads because UBER pays twice per week. Customer service can be challenging due to language barrier. Overall it has worked for us.
2021-10-09 05:46:12,1,Sucks I haven't see any loads for a couple months
2021-10-08 11:37:59,1,Uber Freight is there a direct person to talk to .. I was late with my load... I have been sitting on my load for more than 24 hours.. Is there a direct person to talk to... I need help .... They is no one to talk to...
2021-10-05 20:00:40,5,Convenient booking
2021-10-05 14:18:33,5,"Easy, Faster and serious app."
2021-10-01 14:13:23,5,Nice and simple.
2021-09-26 07:55:54,3,Diring searching loads date often stucks and will not change to another. Also app switches to load was delivered and stopes tracking ofted during simple stop before delivery make sure to roll it back or detention might be refused.
2021-09-26 05:43:38,1,App keeps crashing and wont work no matter how many times I reinatall it.
2021-09-24 17:40:00,1,"they getting worse with every day, if you have problems with load, support India takes few days! you are on your own"
2021-09-22 13:04:23,3,"Gave this app 3 stars because while it has been easy for me to book loads or get help from support, the usability of the app has gone down considerably. Anytime I click on the filter options once, I can never click on them again. I have to restart the app each time to click on the same filter option. Load searching and viewing are more limited as well. It seems as if you need to be in the current area for where you want to pickup a load or else you won't get many results."
2021-09-20 12:46:39,3,"When you arrive near the delivery place, app will automatically remove the load as if it's delivered. This should be fixed. My appointment is Tomorrow and arrived at a truck stop near the warehouse but the app says load is delivered just because I arrive near the delivery city. This is wrong . Please developer, prevent the app from doing this . Delivery should be manually done by the driver."
2021-09-17 22:15:31,5,Hopefully Uber will broaden its geographical areas for more load options.
2021-09-17 11:56:48,5,Easy to use
2021-09-13 23:13:23,5,They fixed the problem that I had with the app and the customer service was great. Thank you UF

2021-09-08 16:41:52,5,"Uber Freight continues to improve their app, which is great, they've made it as easy a possible to browse for and see the info about loads,if you like it, click and accept the load you want, it's that easy, I only wish we could bid on all loads, not a select few, but other than that small issue, they'll get 5 thumbs up out of 5 in my book as wellüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
2021-09-08 15:17:41,5,I enjoy the loads and pay
2021-09-08 13:57:18,5,Very good job to the developer. Keep it up now in these days with the latest technology we have is very attractive to have something like this. I really love it. Thanks again when I have my own company I definitely will use you guys as my first priority.
2021-09-04 22:35:59,2,Worst costumer support and should be able to bid on every load.
2021-09-04 21:37:41,5,"Like everything on earth Uber has its flaws,but let me tell you something if you can't be well off using this app and I don't mean surviving I mean building a fleet the problem ain't the app!"
2021-09-03 22:50:43,5,Very easy to use. Easy to find loads and quick to receive settlements.
2021-09-03 13:09:45,5,Great app
2021-08-30 09:29:29,5,love working with Uber!
2021-08-27 23:22:23,4,Wish bidding were more readily available
2021-08-26 12:10:22,5,Fantastic
2021-08-26 07:07:35,4,OS&D department is horrid to put it nicely.
2021-08-25 02:34:11,5,Awesome thanks
2021-08-24 21:37:46,1,"Worst customer support ever. Worst escalation process ever. Long story short shipper refused to take in the load so asked for reschedule for drop off, and every time I call this matter is been handled with high priority and urgency. 24hrs later issue not resolved. I asked for the load to be returned and shipper to be notified and I was told shipper was notified, 4 hrs later shipper refused to take the load because no RM#. If you going to use this app make sure you have plenty of time to deliver."
2021-08-23 20:52:41,5,Thank you
2021-08-21 21:37:17,5,Good loads

2021-08-06 23:29:01,1,Have a problem? You will sit for hours and never get a call back! Also very hard to get ahold of anyone that you can understand!
2021-08-06 07:25:02,5,So far so good. Consistent improvements and excellent support response times. Transparent booking and quick settlement processes removing all the unnecessary hassle typical of the industry. Likely to continue to improve and disrupt the industry for better and improved performance of all parties operating in the industry. A win-win proposition for all wanting to simplify life and work organically.
2021-08-05 04:35:17,5,I love it

2021-07-29 22:58:28,1,Well not worth the time to download i even did it 3 times and all three times i can get to the log in screen then it says sorry theres a problem and cant get back into the app. This is stupid in todays technology i should be able to use an app that thay have out and not get a stupid error screen apparently they dont k ow how to write a program to work .

2021-07-28 16:51:51,1,"Getting ready to uninstall. No loads? Zip, zero, zilch everyday. Even when I get email saying 12 loads available, I go to the app, no loads available. NOT IMPRESSED"

2021-07-08 21:32:54,4,Uber treats me right.
2021-07-08 02:12:50,5,Very Nice!
2021-07-07 19:03:23,4,Great app. Good amount of loads posted daily. Wish we could have the option to bid on more or all loads
2021-07-07 00:13:44,4,A friendly app to work with
2021-07-06 15:02:09,4,Works very well easy to use.
2021-07-05 13:12:39,5,"Booking loads with Uber freight is really cool, and fast and ready to go to work right away. Thanks to the Lord and Uber freight."
2021-06-30 20:37:32,5,Easy to work with
2021-06-26 23:58:22,1,They bait and switch load prices watch out. I screen shot it as proof and if i could upload phots i would and will. Load qas offer at $3400 go to book it it drops to $2970
2021-06-26 16:58:59,5,We all different but to me they are the best they treat me good
2021-06-23 20:10:53,3,Times between pickup and delivery are too short. We should be able to bid on times.
2021-06-21 13:39:42,5,so far I've been making good money here
2021-06-20 03:39:16,1,Worked exactly about like I figured it would
2021-06-17 01:23:29,5,One of the best customers care among other big brokers.
2021-06-16 06:11:31,5,Great loads with great pay
2021-06-15 18:45:30,1,Still can get in I sent my dot mc and insurance they asked me to call there 844 number but they are no help I just won't to drive
2021-06-11 14:39:07,1,Attention carriers Uber as a app is good but they delay payments For no reason and they Try to not pay Lay overs And there Call centre in Philippines doesn't help you They only try to learn English over the phone an actually right now that I'm writing this They still haven't paid me a load Have been more than 7 days And you can not get in touch with a broker to see what going on we try uber freight support so many times and so far nothing works
2021-06-10 22:17:55,1,This app sucks now since my latest update. It wo let me look for loads if they are not around my area. Even if I search different city it will show me loads 200 mile radius only
2021-06-08 20:43:42,1,App will not start my loadboard what will I have to do to get my loadboard restarded
2021-06-06 02:42:24,1,"Been trying to install app for a month. Finally got someone to send me carrier packet, got signed up, now the load board won't load. Something went wrong we can't reach our servers. Called support, they say it's my internet connection. The only thing I can't connect to is the uber load board."
2021-06-05 22:40:51,5,Great experience
2021-06-05 22:38:03,1,Uber has changed the system so much that is hard to find a load because of their dedicated loads and not enough bids.
2021-06-05 05:17:58,5,Good app for Get load
2021-06-03 23:12:21,5,Love this apps ease of use
2021-06-03 01:40:21,5,"Love working with them,rates $$$ are above average"
2021-06-02 18:43:35,1,Keeps making me sign up all over again. Never able to access a loadboard if there is one. Keeps saying someone will get back to me if any questions; no one ever does. I've signed up multiple times over the last 4 months. There is no support to contact.
2021-06-02 18:38:15,1,This company wants you too run for pennies on the dollar
2021-06-01 18:43:31,3,Everything seems to work fine until you need help with pick up/delivery appointments or pick up number. It could take hours or days before they give you any update because you will be dealing third party call center some ware in India. Hope you don't need them.
2021-06-01 15:16:29,5,Easy to book loads and get paid
2021-05-30 19:57:01,5,I love this APP it kind of created for driver.
2021-05-28 15:54:48,1,Not user freindly apps
2021-05-28 03:23:52,5,Very satisfying working with uberfreight
2021-05-26 19:20:57,1,I made a user name and password but can't get in....I did call Uber freight and they told me that they would give me a call within 24 hours I never got that call or email this is a hard loadboard to sign up for it's now been 3 days and I haven't been able to sign up for
2021-05-26 18:57:18,1,"App SUCKS! You can't even save a lane. Every time you enter your information and click next, it erases what you've entered. App is a total waste of time. This is why I don't use Uber hardly ever."
2021-05-26 05:09:09,5,Arunas Mazonas great ap great rates i liket
2021-05-21 23:22:14,3,So So
2021-05-21 17:52:48,5,Great
2021-05-21 13:45:04,1,"Starting out everything and everyone has been great. On 4/7/21 they didn't have anybody to pu a load out of VA got to NC. PU and deliver the same day. Booked the load 4 hrs past appointment. And knew that it would be a work in. After finishing loading, was told they would take it if I got there b4 midnight. Showed up at 10:58, and they appointment numbers they gave me, didn't work. Call and they gave me the run around. Was told the next appointment would be 4 days later. No pay for sitting üòï"
2021-05-20 22:12:54,1,"Terrible app, won't let me sign in after several password resets...keeps saying Something went wrong, try again"
2021-05-20 14:00:55,3,Need away to remove dumb bundles
2021-05-20 02:31:08,5,Very easy to use and effevtive.

2021-05-18 15:12:37,5,They paid me detection for two days automatic... better and others company to be fighting for Extra $
2021-05-17 03:02:55,5,They are the best üëå and app very easy to use
2021-05-16 20:45:29,5,Its great ez straight to the point
2021-05-16 19:11:12,5,All good
2021-05-16 04:09:51,1,Not working! Can't even log in!
2021-05-13 16:07:33,5,Very considerate
2021-05-11 16:58:21,3,The new system for choosing loads is too complicated too many options sometimes get me confused
2021-05-10 23:35:48,5,Easy to use .
2021-05-10 00:09:14,2,Now automatic tracker doesn't work. In the location options 'Allow all the time' is missing?
2021-05-08 15:37:07,5,"I have called with so many questions and Uber customer care, they have been so helpful."
2021-05-06 02:50:36,5,Awesome way better than TOTAL QUALITY LOGISTICS THEM BROKERS ALWAYS TRYING TO SCAM U FOR THE LAST PENNY!!!
2021-05-05 20:25:29,4,"I'm bumping the app from 3 to 4 stars. They have reduced their tracking calls finally! Seems like the quality of loads (yes, quality not quantity) have diminished lately as I keep collecting TONU's from them. And 150.00 doesn't really cut it when a truck travels 120 miles and waits several hours for it. If this continues, my rating will go back down."
2021-05-05 08:45:07,5,No drivers should roll out with out this app üòä
2021-05-03 19:43:46,5,25year espirensia
2021-05-02 20:18:48,5,Easiest app to use when it comes to finding freight and getting detention or lumpers fees
2021-05-01 14:08:27,5,Exelent app
2021-04-29 01:13:15,5,Love it
2021-04-29 00:59:53,4,"Very easy to use the app, very professional people ,good company to do business with."
2021-04-28 20:24:53,5,Pretty good
2021-04-28 19:31:41,4,"Lately the app is slow as ever to load, and recently, gives me an error that something went wrong and to refresh. This is not very helpful or useful for when a driver is trying to book loads and they are unable due to an error."
2021-04-27 21:54:51,1,We should be able to rate the pick up location not have to wait until the delivery drop cause it's not the same driver and this location I go to needs some attention with how rude and nasty they are to drivers
2021-04-26 13:27:48,5,Feel like this is going to be a very nice run like this.
2021-04-21 20:25:27,5,Good
2021-04-20 12:51:47,4,Need more bidding options
2021-04-16 21:16:55,1,Really bad. Don't use it.
2021-04-16 10:32:27,4,More details on the load description Pick-up distance Load range Active location More organized compared to other.
2021-04-16 03:36:35,1,"The app is easy to use, rate per miles is not bad, Uber customer service is the worse in the United States, they don't respond to the carrier problems never, they never call you back or give you an answer to nothing, they ignored you on my opinion they treat you like s--- you pay the cost of the free app, if you have delay or detention they don't care and don't call because they never call you back"
2021-04-15 11:40:02,5,App functions Great... easy to navigate
2021-04-14 20:37:02,5,App works great
2021-04-14 15:10:55,1,Latest update restricts the ability of the carrier to contest a score rating on a carrier performance report for late arrivals. The performance report WILL NOT allow the user to enter the info needed to contest. This is a must fix to ensure carriers are allowed to correct inaccurate scores.
2021-04-10 02:24:17,5,"""The app doesn't accept my pickup and delivery locations, they just changed back to Near Me and Anywhere..."" The interface changed significantly. Clear Data, log back in, and you're back in business."

2021-04-07 08:46:22,5,Excellent assistance
2021-04-07 01:05:18,1,"I can't pull up loads in my area. App keeps telling me to widen my delivery area to 200 plus miles because I am missing out on loads.. I do that and then it says ""all caught up"". App is not working."
2021-04-06 12:09:50,1,I don't see how this place stays in business. Picked up a load in Memphis Tennessee & lost 7 hours from waiting to be loaded & appointment fir next day at noon. In which the delivery place is closed over the weekend. They finally called last night said to deliver at 6am & I get here place says they don't start receiving until 8am & with appointment. So got to waste more time trying to set up new appointment time . & all the operators I have spoken with from this app can barely understand Eng
2021-04-05 16:19:23,5,Uber freight has improved and hopefully they will continue to work thanks
2021-04-05 00:42:20,5,Practical and fair. Great customer support.
2021-04-04 21:44:55,5,Satisfied
2021-04-02 22:44:04,1,After you pick up a load it blocks you from being able to pick up a return load. Ive also booked loads and had the information disappear. Fix the bugs and issues with app.
2021-04-01 01:32:38,5,Good
2021-03-31 07:03:44,1,If I could give this new update a 0 I would. Won't even allow me to check the area that I'm headed into. Can't book with them anymore.
2021-03-30 22:35:44,1,Ever since your update it has no loads like it did before I'm lucky to have one on there very disappointing
2021-03-30 16:48:14,5,Best customer service good response any time you need to speak with any employer
2021-03-28 16:22:06,2,To complicated
2021-03-28 01:12:23,5,Great optional choice
2021-03-25 13:58:06,5,Job well done
2021-03-25 01:31:25,1,The new design is not good! Every time we try to do a search in a area it resort back to near me... Tried to save lanes...it resort back to near me...major issues!
2021-03-24 07:26:11,5,Love it
2021-03-22 13:33:16,1,They changed the app now you have to keep putting your starting point every time you open the app and the dates were at the top easy to work with now it sucks the old app was way better
2021-03-21 00:37:40,5,Uber has been wonderful working with great rates with legal drive time for delivery and pick ups
2021-03-17 23:33:39,1,It's no longer working... i ges have to look elsewhere for loads.
2021-03-16 16:54:04,1,App says my company's D.O.T number is not a number so I can't get passed the account setup page. I will be happy to give more stars when this issue is fixed but as of right now I can only give you 1 star.
2021-03-16 11:31:00,5,It's a really good app
2021-03-15 01:19:09,5,"I just updated the App now I can't look at any area except ""Nearby"" (Edit) Had to uninstall and reinstall and working perfectly Still one of my favorite load boards."
2021-03-14 15:26:53,1,You are the worst ever in everything
2021-03-13 03:19:43,5,I make more MONEY with Uber Freight ‚ù§.

2021-03-07 16:12:19,5,Good app
2021-03-07 11:39:28,5,Easy app to get around and they put in great details about each load
2021-03-07 02:15:05,1,No me funciona. Is not working
2021-03-06 03:37:19,2,"It takes a long time to load. After scrolling down, it just stop and can't do nothing."
2021-03-05 19:17:28,1,VERY BAD. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE
2021-03-05 14:11:51,4,Better than I thought
2021-03-04 10:32:14,1,"GIT TRANSPORT LLC, SENT MY BANKING INFORMATION IN.Still sent my $ to wrong account now got me waiting almost 3wks to get paid due to their error.Thats. on two pay outs.UBER doesn't have good service and not good on processing documents. Wouldn't be my first choice to work forüëéüèæ"
2021-03-02 20:32:34,5,Very good company to get loads from.
2021-03-02 15:49:32,5,Excellent ease of use. Tracking is great!
2021-03-01 15:38:14,5,"Very helpful and easy to use, great personal. Thank you Ufreight."
2021-03-01 13:55:41,5,Awesome job!!!! THANKS
2021-02-28 15:45:51,5,They are the best they're paying their money on time
2021-02-27 17:49:50,5,Easy to use. No hassle.
2021-02-25 18:53:59,5,It's a good trucking app
2021-02-25 12:11:34,2,This app is not allowing me to search for other locations why please advise me is anything change
2021-02-25 02:04:06,1,Very poor operating performance
2021-02-23 06:41:02,5,"I worked with Uber freight for quite a while now and I can tell, this guys mastered the game! Best layout of loads and quick pay without any fees! I hope all other big brokers like TQL will follow the lead and make their loadboard apps the same way!"
2021-02-22 23:36:54,5,GOOD APP
2021-02-20 21:55:22,1,"I drove 150 miles to pickup a load, I get there on time but shipper had cancelled the load on previous day, then Uber gives me a bad rating because they didn't cancel the load like they should have."
2021-02-20 17:15:39,1,There are exactly 0 helpful people when you call and you have to call about EVERYTHING. We even had a load that the company cancelled due to bad weather and they did not inform me it cancelled so drove 150 miles to pick it up and the reciever was closed. Not only that but when we called to tell them it was closed they said wait ... waited 4 hours for someone to figure out how to cancel the load and after 4 phone calls they still said wait.... next day recieved an email asking if we delivered.
2021-02-16 20:54:35,5,Great app for Owner
2021-02-14 00:07:40,5,The app is very straight forward and works well. All the basic information a carrier needs is right there. No nonsense here.
2021-02-11 19:59:30,5,"Best rates you'll find, they don't harras you every 2 hrs, easy to find loads and routes home."
2021-02-11 00:37:03,1,"totally glitchy app. uninstalled several times, still does nothing but crash"
2021-02-09 23:50:21,5,Push button loadboard and no games. Pick and go!
2021-02-09 02:00:18,5,"Uber app is on top of it's game and there rates are good if not better than the rest. Other apps putting bids in I find they always don't want to pay for what the load should pay, cheap freight. We work to hard trying to provide good service to them only to get down played by low rates."

2021-01-20 19:50:18,4,Very Good Experience for the most part ! The App does Not save Trailer type or City . This needs Fixing ! I hope they will Correct Soon ! User interface is Not that intuitive either . I Hope some Feedback & Reading of Reviews will bring Change ! My Review will be Higher with Improvements ! - Thank You !!!
2021-01-16 05:29:43,1,"The bidding feature is automated to calculate all the variables. Then counters your offer by 5 dollars more. If you don't take the offer, you will have to bid again in 15 min. I say, just leave my offer until someone win. I have other stuff to do."
2021-01-16 03:02:31,1,"You really need to put something in settings to input truck and trailer numbers into, so they aren't calling me for that information!"

2020-10-26 13:23:41,4,"Great app, would be 5 stars but still have problems getting paid detention. Wish they would send you a new rate con with the detention added."
2020-10-26 13:16:48,3,It your asking your self why app keep closing on you? It's because they are trying to force you to update which brings you to a much bigger headache. Sooo many changes like no booking ahead no more reload options available in other words they want to to book not knowing what you getting your self in coming out.. Not smart thing to do.. Good luck
2020-10-26 12:10:58,1,Terrible this compnay doesn't care about anyone but their self and their bottom line. They will fight dentetion even when they know the customer is wrong. Arrived at the customers onetime then had to sit almost for 18 hours only to be told send in proof of time when the customer wouldn't put it in on the sheet. Then get to the reciever and going to have to wait another 20 hours to get unloaded when the compnay stated that uber never called to make a new appointment. Now no response
2020-10-22 21:23:30,1,"Wow, this sucks do not update your app, unable to book loads in advance. Thought Uber actually would start making money. Looks like they need to fix the update"
2020-10-22 18:52:58,5,Uber always pick up phone calls fast.
2020-10-22 14:36:55,1,"Uber going downhill? Use to be ok, lately the app is freezing or just restarts for no reason. The location is sometime way off. Also, not sure if it's the system, some kind of software or an actual person doing the load pairing for multiple days but so.e of those loads do not make any sense unless Uber isn't considering hours of service rules. Take a look at JB Hunts app, they have it mostly figured out but not completely. Convoy isn't too bad either."
2020-10-16 13:51:43,1,They not pay detention anymore
2020-10-15 22:19:01,5,Good job

2020-10-04 14:00:29,3,"App keeps crashing since yesterday 10/3/20, is there an ongoing maintenance or what could be the reason for that? It would just open for couple of seconds and close right back again. I'm using an Android phone."
2020-10-04 03:11:04,5,Easy to use
2020-10-04 02:22:45,5,"Love being able to plan out my route, see prices and search all areas!! Very easy to book loads."

2020-09-22 20:48:28,1,"App is fine.. But Uber Freight customer service team is the worse in the market.. Especially their payroll department, which is the reason people work.. Also they call you once every 20 miles to get a location, truck number and trailer.."

2020-09-21 17:39:35,5,Fast and easy to work with.
2020-09-21 16:33:43,2,TOO MANY canceled loads. DO NOT DEADHEAD any distance unless you don't care if the load cancels and $150 is worth your trouble!
2020-09-20 04:02:11,5,"Great application, easy to use and book load, this app wins competition on the load market. Simplicity is more important to user. No problem at all with this app."
2020-09-17 22:58:13,1,DO NOT BOOK CHEAP LOADS UBER IS A RIPP OFF THEY MADE ME WAIT 2 DAYS AT A STOP AND PAID ME $200 SMH NOT EVEN LAYOVER..DONT WAIST YOUR TIME MONEY AND FUEL ON THESE PEOPLE!!!@@!!@!!@@###$^^&..Nothing has changed 5 months later..DO NOT BOOK WUTH UBER

2020-09-12 14:55:36,1,Take too long to respond and can't understand your dispatch.
2020-09-11 23:58:22,1,Uber are a bunch of crooks. They try to get you with there low paying rates and always trying to rip you off with detention. APP... can't bid on loads thats a big turn off.

2020-09-11 15:53:51,4,Great app. It would be great to have a weight filter on searching loads.
2020-09-10 22:07:35,5,"Great loads, good rates, very friendly, very heipful when needed. Keep up the good work uber."
2020-09-09 17:05:10,1,Was a good app until most recent update. Now can't click to see the reloads details for the load your looking at. Needs fixed. Now not using.

2020-08-27 01:04:49,3,Money is ok but the support team service is disgraceful. If you ever need help or any assistance THEY WILL NEVER CALL BACK...EVER. I have been left for HOURS and if you ask to speak to a manager EVERYONE IS THE MANAGER. Proceed at your own risk
2020-08-26 17:28:42,5,"Great app, but does not upload live location to see loads within a certain distance i guess it says on your domicile, great great customer services.."

2020-08-22 00:29:13,1,"Only good for new Comer who don't know market rat, Uber Freight try everything to bring owner operator bussines to bankruptcy by doing low rate every load, now they also wanna share our ELD DATA with others to see where is more truck so they can bring price more down capacity bass, what I want to say dear Uber Freight stop being cheap n compare ur rate to other broker or with Convoy they doing great, I just logged out uberfreight account not doing anymore cheap load ."

2020-08-10 15:28:01,1,"Horrible support!! If you have an issue forget about any support. Weekends you won't get anybody who can do anything to help, even at nights it's pointless. Can't login into app anymore without creating another account."
2020-08-09 21:58:13,1,"This company is actively contributing into biased bigotry and supporting Marxist groups. They are giving money to people of certain skin pigmentation and calling it a way to fight racism. We are in a country that gives the same opportunity to everyone. They do not value America as the freesist country in the world all in the name of being political and being woke, now I hope you go broke."
2020-08-09 18:03:09,5,Wish all Brokerages had detailed easy to use load boards like Uber Nice job Team !

2020-08-04 17:40:00,1,App doesn't work
2020-08-04 15:54:24,5,A good and easy way to book load from the load Board.
2020-08-04 00:42:54,2,This app needs updating or something. What is the point of having tracking on your app if the only way it works is when the app is open and running? They call you over and over for updates on your location and make you insane. It makes no sense to think a trucker is going to have your app open and running on his phone eating up data all day. Everyone else knows how to enable tracking all the time on their apps Im pretty sure Uber could figure it out if they wanted to.
2020-07-29 15:41:56,5,My first load was a great rate and customer service is very understanding with every situation.
2020-07-28 10:49:34,5,Get App
2020-07-28 03:31:38,1,I booked a load with Uber one time. They changed the delivery time when I was in transit without even sending me an email/ calling me to say that the appointment was changed.
2020-07-26 14:34:33,5,Very easy to use. Automatic tracking in the app. Docs upload easily as well.
2020-07-24 17:39:12,5,"Good, I like it"
2020-07-24 16:01:34,5,They keep me ROLLING at competitive rates
2020-07-21 15:12:11,5,"Great rates, support, load choice!"
2020-07-20 23:06:59,5,Very satisfy
2020-07-20 06:26:23,5,Very good
2020-07-19 23:58:31,5,Everything working fine
2020-07-15 23:14:42,5,Great App.
2020-07-15 21:53:42,5,Good
2020-07-15 15:05:29,5,One of my most commonly used load apps.
2020-07-15 13:25:53,5,App is very convenient and easy to use
2020-07-14 22:42:15,3,App is not working not showing any loads from any state
2020-07-14 18:39:40,1,No step deck
2020-07-13 12:39:04,5,Super easy to use!
2020-07-12 13:41:23,1,I can't even log onto the app to see what uber freight has to offer üòíüò°
2020-07-11 02:03:18,1,"App will not let me log in. It says there is an issue with my email address. Tried calling, no answer. Tried emailing, no response. Really would like to use this app. One thing that is really odd from what I can see of it so far though is the number of typos in the app. They are numerous, for such a large and established company it honestly made me think it was a fake app for a moment. Even the responses to these reviews are riddled with horrible and incoherent typos."
2020-07-10 00:52:25,4,"Been using this app for years. I like it. But they have been doing some upgrades aimed at trying to get you to buy into the premium. I get it, thats ok. But now its harder to navigate the fr√©e version. And limiting news and info, such as discontinuing the Trending heading . I'm looking for another app. While I'm playing with this new version to figure out if it's me or the new updates, I think it's them."
2020-07-09 17:51:48,3,"Its hard to say, they update every few days. They make changes for the worst lol, they put more junk in it you dont need, the app drags even with a good signal, they call you all the time for load updates lol. why do we have to constantly re-enter search criteria when you know my fleet has only dryvans, i dont run multi stop loads. when the app first came out this app was great, but now it gets worst with every update."
2020-07-08 02:31:18,1,"App show me only 12 loads around Harrisburg, PA for whole week. Call support 3 times already but they know nothing. Also it don't let you book a load within 8 hours after delivery appointment if you have Uber load. Support can't help too. Good broker, at least for me, but if you have some problem it's almost impossible to get help from them."

2020-07-01 14:33:47,5,"I LOVE Uber Freight! They have TONS of great paying loads, free quick pay twice a week if using the app, immediate approval for detention (zero haggling), prepaid lumper fees, etc. I use other broker boards too but honestly for all the headache relief & steam lined efficiency of using Uber Freights load board app, I'd much rather book with Uber. I use Uber Freight app more than any other load board now. Super easy & user friendly. They just keep getting better with more benefits to truckers."

2020-05-16 03:12:16,5,"Great app, loads heavy and light. Like the fact that you can see the price and negotiateon some loads, not like CHR .............................. ........ you have to wait for price and their associates take too long to reply back.

2020-05-15 01:44:37,4,"Yes, the app is ok but Uber needs to increase the pay for most of the loads we are hard working drivers and deserve it."
2020-05-14 16:30:49,2,Rates use to be okay but now they are very cheap. The loads are heavy and sometimes when I book a load they will take it off you at the last minute while you are in route to the shipper and tell you its been rescheduled for another day and you ask them what day it's been rescheduled they will tell you it's already booked by another carrier. We as owner operators work to hard to be getting run arounds and heavy cheap loads that we should be getting paid more for. Anyway God knows and see's all.
2020-05-14 13:28:09,5,"Better than the others, easy and smooth"
2020-05-13 14:17:56,4,"It would be nice to be able to BID on ALL loads, receive notifications if you WIN or LOSE a BID, have a save button so u can go back and look at loads you are interested in, be able to assign ANY driver that is in your fleet to any load and switch drivers if necessary thru the app, be able to request loads from destinations and get notifications of new loads added in the area you requested."

2020-05-09 11:25:20,1,Cheap loads...
2020-05-08 00:48:47,3,Uber app was supposed to have a new tab for bidding on a load I tried to update it but nothing comes up yet.
2020-05-07 02:44:19,1,I'm unable to install this app. It won't download to my phone... I've had previous versions but could not update so I uninstalled thinking I could reinstall and it won't install.
2020-05-06 18:20:57,5,Like the fact you be able to bid
2020-05-06 18:09:33,5,Very good
2020-05-06 15:58:39,1,Says there are loads but none will show up. Send notifications and nothing on app.
2020-05-06 15:19:18,5,Thanks for the update
2020-05-06 15:13:54,3,"Well I just updated but nothing new, it's not giving me any option for bids"
2020-05-02 19:53:13,5,Thank you
2020-04-28 13:33:57,5,Great app
2020-04-28 01:55:49,1,Extremely load rates
2020-04-24 17:12:14,4,My experience has been good with a few exceptions... But the rates have gotten so LOW that it makes it difficult to operate... No trucker should be asked to haul freight for these LOW LOW rates. Please remember... trucks move EVERYTHING you buy.
2020-04-23 23:15:52,3,Will this be available in NZ?
2020-04-23 13:15:25,3,No1 speaks English

2020-04-22 00:00:53,5,Cool app
2020-04-20 15:13:36,5,Perfect App
2020-04-19 02:41:10,1,Cheapest freight loadboard in history stay away from this loadboard they are trying to break the trucking industry. The main goal of uber feight is to lower freight rate to under a dollar a mile.
2020-04-18 03:28:55,1,"Madhurima Tiruttani and Eric Cruickshank both of them are an evil cold blooded premeditated person they stole my money I called to uber they don't care please stay way fr these people. We are here all truckers risking our lives to help to community but uber rep they started stealing it really hurts , imagine when you don't sleep all night make sure the freight delivers on time with no problem but uber representatives especially Madhurima Tiruttani and Eric Cruickshank both of them are thief don't talk to them they can't make solutions because they are thief i requested to talk with manager they claim to be ceo or something this is my business i can do whatever because of this now i hate uber"
2020-04-17 15:58:00,5,Overall pleased
2020-04-17 04:57:03,5,"I've been using uber freight for about two years, and the app works fine and plenty of freight to keep you busy. But my complaint is that Uber started out with customers paying good money for moving their fright, but now I believe your losing good carriers to other load boards because no Owner operator can survive on fright you can barely pay for fuel. I use to run 2 to 3 loads a week, now It's down to 2 loads every three weeks. I just can't find anything with decent pay on your load board."
2020-04-17 03:46:17,5,App is easy to use support is always there to help on any issue .
2020-04-17 03:18:04,1,Sucks
2020-04-16 21:21:07,5,The best load board
2020-04-16 15:28:48,1,Any supervisor of dispatches please email me asap
2020-04-16 14:48:51,1,uber is soo cheap it's not funny. Uber freight determines which load you view depending on your pick up and drop time per appointment. But then their app example : my app at 1300. Delivery app 0300. I pick up 1100 depart 1200. Delivery 0204 depart 0950. Uber freight app logs I picked up 1700 and delivered 0500. Making you late then logs detention time appointment at 0700 rather than 0300. For this you only gonna haul cheap freight. Capitalism at best.
2020-04-15 20:00:19,5,Work for me
2020-04-15 17:07:42,1,This app sucks this company sucks one phone number on load board no one ever answers always to voicemail they pick up hang up never take the old covered loads down so u could be calling over over or on hold for a load that has been gone. Customer service is worse they should just stick to shipping ppl its annoying and they actually have good lanes
2020-04-14 18:38:24,5,Great App
2020-04-14 00:41:53,5,Easy to use for business.
2020-04-11 22:16:47,3,"THIS suppor nice and so easy to used. BUT, they have to many heavy loads and the price too low when you compare the lb,DESl,miles its meaningless. OTHER than this greate HELP center, evey thing is on time if not they pay DETENTION,lumpers,.,etc."
2020-04-10 13:58:00,1,Am unable to download the app on my note 9 android phone.
2020-04-09 18:34:03,1,Does not work for me at all. I can't search for any load. Always said no match.

2020-04-05 12:58:33,5,EASY TO USE
2020-04-04 20:03:27,1,Suggestions for UBER..... 1) Increase rate to national averages. 2) Reduce weight of loads. 45000 lbs is too heavy for most dry van loads. Those loads belong on a train. 3) Reduce check calls. 4) Allow bidding
2020-04-04 15:41:33,5,Easy
2020-04-04 09:52:09,5,Good
2020-04-03 14:05:31,1,Cant even log in Changed password. Now it won't even let me use that one...

2020-04-01 17:54:40,1,Garbage.first load was fake and i drove 200 miles for no reson...apt time was not real and when i got to the shipper there was no such load with my pick up number..uber had problems with the load and never made another apt to fix it..
2020-03-31 17:48:33,5,I like Uber freight easy for picking up & delivery load
2020-03-29 16:48:43,5,Easy to use
2020-03-27 12:33:19,3,Is easy and straight forward app itself The company itself are inconsiderate about paying detention. It doesn't matter if shipper/receiver gives you documentation if in and out time not on BOL they won't pay. The app Needs to be more forward like check in/out requesting lumber fee/detention ect. Love the way they 24/7 and direct. Convoy app is everything but they are a 3rd party if UBER app was as theirs they'll be right on.
2020-03-26 21:28:02,1,app is not working
2020-03-24 22:38:06,2,They deactivated my account 3 days before my insurance expire and when I sent them updated it takes about 3 weeks to review it and activate my account. So I couldn't book loads and work for 3 days! This is terrible slow service!! üëéüëé

2020-03-02 21:54:17,1,Once u open the app it gives u the option to sign in or to creat an accouny. I already have an account so i enter my email and password but it tells me sorry this email is attached to an existing uber accouny. Please choose another email to creat an account! I do not want to creat an account! I want to sign in. This existant account attached to my email is mine! I didnot even get to sign in what a useless app and waste of time!
2020-03-01 20:36:02,2,Im a driver Pulled a load for them and was at the shipper like 8 hours and the reciever for 5 hours requested detention pay for the hours had in and out times for both never got detention pay from them sent emails about it they never responded to the email
2020-02-29 13:33:49,1,"Booking a load is easy . Cancel easy. But if incase something happen it's hard to get issue resolved. Because their costumer service don't know nothing about the trucking industry, and they can't give you decisions."
2020-02-26 19:15:05,1,"When it comes to rates Uber Freight has decent rates. The pay is fast & they even calculate the detention for you. Where they lack is caring for their Carriers. If there is an overage in a load, your are totally screwed. Must sit on it for at least 12hrs & wait for a disposition. They will not consider you having another load to get back to you in a timely matter; so cancel all loads & work for free for them from this point on. The Customer Service the worst, Noone higher than them for anything"
2020-02-26 16:41:46,1,Sent me to a customer with a 5 ton road then blamed me when I complained they are booking buisness without reviewing area around. Stay away!

2020-02-24 02:08:24,1,"Their loads are cheap, they post them with heavy weight even up to 46000lbs, no number to call so as to check the weight, so when you book uber loads you really don't know how much you are hauling"

2020-02-21 03:46:38,1,"I couldn't even drive for Uber eats they wouldn't get back to me for three months. I have a truck I wouldn't drive for them at all. They can't even get me started with Uber eats, Postmates I was driving within an hour and could call customer service, an actual person. Terrible."

2020-01-24 16:43:44,1,"Worst thing to have happened to trucking industry. They create their own rules as they go along. Make you upload BOL multiple places for detention, only for you to slip somewhere so that they can avoid your claim to detention. Take you off of a load whenever they want without any explanation. This will be the death of owner Operator trucking in near future. Avoid at all cost!!! Stop taking cheap frieght. You can never get hold of actual account manager and everything is always 'escalated'. B.S"

2019-12-28 13:14:17,2,The freight price between MONTREAL and Toronto $200 less then normal per trip
2019-12-27 21:18:17,1,"Cheap loads. Bad customer service , my load was cancelled at shipper , uber make me wait 7 fu.... hrs in order to get the TONU, lost 2 other loads cuz that. Stay away from them, that's my advice"
2019-12-24 04:20:15,1,"When I got my DOT, I was hauling 100% of my load with uber freight. But after being abscent from the app for 2 months for vacation, I found out that i was logged off from the app. I called and emailed them, I was told to haul from their brokers for some time before I can get access to the app. I told to one of my cousin who also works with uber, he was surprised. But they did the same thing to him when he went for vacation. I don't know if it's their way to make you work with their brokers, but i feel like they don't respect for small carriers, they just wand to give you orders and you have to follow them."
2019-12-23 02:58:50,4,Great way to find loads without having to deal with money hungry brokers that are only looking out for their best interests
2019-12-22 15:57:01,5,Good
2019-12-20 20:18:34,5,Works well
2019-12-20 18:50:54,3,"Out of nowhere the application just stopped working. I have not been able to get application running again. I keep getting a message that says: ""cannot reach our servers"". Uber fix this issue please thank you"
2019-12-20 02:19:43,1,Can't log in says my account has been blocked
2019-12-19 06:14:32,5,great app
2019-12-18 13:40:57,5,Good app to booked loads the rate's aren't so great.
2019-12-18 00:07:24,2,"Should allow us to place a bid as well, compete with other top apps, rates have been killing us, having to look elsewhere."
2019-12-17 16:20:06,1,This company is scam they just want destroy this market Like the taxi and get all your money don't use this app believe me just work with something else .
2019-12-17 13:43:58,5,User friendly app
2019-12-16 21:24:50,1,Try to open goes blank....
2019-12-16 16:05:00,5,Ok
2019-12-16 04:04:03,5,I cant download the new version of uber freight.
2019-12-15 20:01:21,4,Would be helpful if uber freight collecting more loads and bunch
2019-12-15 17:01:01,5,No feedback my app
2019-12-14 14:42:41,5,Pdrfect app
2019-12-14 02:43:36,5,Senior dispatch
2019-12-13 17:51:02,3,Is so so
2019-12-12 22:45:20,3,rates low
2019-12-12 22:01:28,5,Fantastic way to get loads for an owner operator awesome app
2019-12-12 18:50:19,5,Not bad
2019-12-12 18:41:42,5,Great App
2019-12-12 17:26:56,2,Cant understand people when i call n with a problem it seem like a call
2019-12-12 16:51:23,3,No way to ask for more pay
2019-12-12 15:01:43,5,Great app
2019-12-12 13:51:30,4,"Would be much better, if we, the drivers / Dispatchers could make an offer/ bid on the loads, like Convoys app allows."
2019-12-12 12:55:27,4,Rates too low
2019-12-12 10:46:20,1,"They pay quick for the loads, but dont ever expect to get paid for detention or layover, or tonu. They have an excuse for everything. Update, they now use people who are English language challenged, so it's very hard to get a answer to questions"
2019-12-12 09:41:47,4,Great
2019-12-12 05:32:06,1,I cant log in my account...I had to delete and now I can't download the stupid app...sorry for what??? No one to talk to now ...just email us and the what ??? Stupid technology I love old days when you talk to people and get things done for sure Millennials ..hmmm
2019-12-12 05:21:20,5,Good
2019-12-12 01:50:06,5,Good
2019-12-12 01:34:53,4,Okay
2019-12-12 01:24:09,4,Apps ok....Freight is REAL cheap!!
2019-12-10 16:06:19,4,"The app is no nonsense business tool. It is the top broker app my fleet uses. Hopefully with this new update of ""Bundle Freight"" it will maximize truck usage."
2019-12-10 14:15:57,5,"I have to say, uber has impressed me very highly, they can do better on lowing there rates, but other than that, they are very good."
2019-12-10 00:30:35,1,"Just signed up and I can't even log in. I get a ""sorry it looks like there was a problem on our end"" message. I even deleted it and reinstalled it."
2019-12-09 05:11:42,5,The best app out there thank you uber.... G.Sandoval-Martin Gonzales!!!
2019-12-03 00:34:32,1,"I have a story. I booked a load from NJ to FL three days before the actual pick up. I go down there on a Saturday after Thanksgiving for a 10am pick up to find out that someone else took the load two hours prior. Mind you I park my truck in Farmindale, so the tolls to go there and back to farmingdale costed me about $200. To this day I still have not heard nothing about the confusion or how this happened or anything about reimbursing me of my wasted time and tolls."
2019-12-01 23:42:38,5,They have worked very hard too improve this app. I'm very impressed at how much it has improved and the choices of loads. Also with filter. Would like to see filter for specific deadhead distance.
2019-11-28 01:52:09,5,Great app for Owner Operators who want freedom in trucking!!
2019-11-26 00:21:48,1,Last update sucks big time
2019-11-25 17:34:29,2,After updating it yesterday Wont open anymore stuck on t black screen ?? I tried uninstalling it then installed back but still same .
2019-11-25 06:02:50,5,Weldone
2019-11-24 22:10:03,1,What experience? Still unable to open.
2019-11-24 20:34:14,3,App is keep carashing even deleted and reinstalled it several times but still black screen and Uber logo in white fonts.loged on Windows says error occurred.DON NOT LEAVE ME YOUR EMAIL as I don't know any thing further than that.
2019-11-23 16:01:13,2,"Have had to uninstall the app twice because it won't open. When Uber fixes this glitch, I'll be glad to reinstall"
2019-11-23 04:33:25,5,This is the easiest way to book a load. The pay is quick and always correct. Thank you Uber Freight!
2019-11-22 19:41:34,1,They do double book loads. So try not to pick loads that are far out or loads that have bigger window pickup times.
2019-11-22 15:30:09,5,I love the app!! Never had a problem with booking a load or anything else. Easiest way to do business. I don't even have to send an invoice!
2019-11-19 04:44:38,1,"Stupid. Tried to create a account, would not let me use the same phone number as the other uber app. I'm not getting another phone to create a account. Will stick to ups."
2019-11-18 17:57:15,1,"For some reason they appear to have decided not to pay accessorials. They blame it on a ""computer glitch"" but that's the same excuse they used over a month ago. They still ""approve"" detention time- just refuse to pay it. Got some smart aleck named ""Paris"" in customer service who claimed to be the CEO of Uber ""there's no one higher than me"" and refused to give a last name or say when or if they intended to pay. (CEO of Uber is named Dara Khosrowshahi, not Paris #nolastlame)"
2019-11-18 15:42:56,1,"It is very well known in this industry that Tql was/is the broker that paid the least. I had been in rides where i tipped the uber driver and he/she dud not get the full tip. When uber came along, it was great at 1st. I stopped using uber when they charged me more than a regular taxi. I have not booked a single load w uber freight. I thought uber freight was going to be transparent by keeping 10% and bridging the gap between customers/shippers and carriers. Not the case."
2019-11-13 00:41:00,2,"Great app if all you want is to pay expenses without getting ahead. The prices are somewhat fair, but the killer is the appointments. Anytime you book a load with some distance, it's booked to only average 350- 475 miles a day if you run for their appointment schedule. If you call them to ask for an earlier appt, they'll argue instead of understanding that your trying to show a profit - that means utilizing your clock as best you can."
2019-11-11 00:47:01,1,This app sucks. I activated my account and it won't let me log in because it says there's no network connection even though I have full 4G??
2019-11-09 13:59:17,5,It is so freaking easy to book loads ang get paid..
2019-11-09 03:58:34,5,Good
2019-11-08 19:34:05,2,Not works properly: no options sort pick up location by state and option sort loads by deadhead not accurate. Uber hide bad reviews about delivery and pick up locations.
2019-11-07 11:31:03,3,Low rates - load availability is is not good- it's not the best out there anymore.
2019-11-07 02:24:17,5,Easy to use and ver nice app to book loads.once you finish a load and upload the bol doesn't take long to pay.
2019-11-05 16:45:19,5,Its Kool.. But you'll need to let the carrier make an offer..
2019-11-05 15:10:03,1,"When Uber was developing this app all they were thinking is how to get rich quick:They have some of the cheapest freight, app want memorise prefferences,app Cant sort loads by distance... Thanks god for internet so there is lots of brokers coming in to the market cant wait to see them fight for a freight against each other.Broker comission should be around 10% but some of them charge 80% that is crazy and greedy, freight market will soon crash because of it..."
2019-11-05 15:08:54,1,"By far worst freight app I have been using, no ability to bid on the load and no way of quick communication, and worst of all it waste my time by listing available loads 300 miles away from my location . I have just spent 15 minutes on the phone to place a offer on the load and they are saying we will call you if you are selected. Why can't you have a bid price on the loads like every other broker if you are seriously trying to be in this business."
2019-11-01 18:53:19,2,Fair
2019-11-01 16:37:22,5,Love Uber Freight is the best.
2019-10-31 13:25:59,5,Great
2019-10-31 12:35:32,5,Awesome
2019-10-30 23:18:26,5,Excellent
2019-10-30 20:21:48,5,Can we bit on the loads?? Can u specific post Reefer loads.
2019-10-30 14:18:02,5,Iwe like the way you do thingsb
2019-10-30 00:48:11,5,Dealing with Uber Freight is very easy and simple One Touch of a button and making money
2019-10-29 23:18:36,5,5 STAR!!!
2019-10-29 22:26:51,5,Not know
2019-10-29 21:31:20,5,Good
2019-10-29 21:26:40,5,The best
2019-10-29 21:21:34,5,Great
2019-10-29 20:08:57,5,Best service
2019-10-29 19:47:21,5,Working for uber its been the greatest expiriensce in to my bussiness recomend
2019-10-29 19:27:39,1,you think after all this time they'd finally get it right.
2019-10-29 19:26:21,5,Great
2019-10-29 19:16:55,4,Good
2019-10-25 06:13:32,1,I downloaded this app just so I could give it a 1-star rating since Uber took away the driver's 5-star rating counter a year-and-a-half ago so all drivers total 5-star rating count is stuck at what it was back in 2017. bastards
2019-10-24 20:45:45,4,"I don't like how the price of the loads that are posted ""let's say on Monday and by Wed the price for that exact same load went down"" it shouldn't go down it should go up to stay competitive with other top rank load boards. And I don't like how if time is permitted the app won't let you book more than one load to deliver on the same day for example if one load delivers early in the morning and the second load delivers that night hours later and the distance between the two loads are nearby"
2019-10-22 13:34:09,1,Not working good at all
2019-10-21 20:43:33,5,Love this
2019-10-21 13:48:32,1,Suspended account without explanation or waning
2019-10-18 21:37:41,2,This app needs to many features updates. I always try to search load nearby but this all shows available load over 300 miles far from area. They need to update new improvement on this app.
2019-10-18 17:12:51,5,"If ur sick of waiting on hold for a broker just to have them low ball you or find this load is not for you because lack of information on DAT ur gonna LOVE this app!!! All the information about the load, shipper/receiver ratings, clear cut detention...I love it!"
2019-10-16 13:59:47,5,Awesome
2019-10-16 01:00:48,3,"1. When I choose reefer, app doesn't show me dry loads that can be hauled on reefer... 2. App is very slow, at least on Note 9 3. Mostly shippers write 38-40k but when you get they'll load you maximum what they can 43-44k. And UBER FREIGHT doesn't compensate that 4. Booking numbers are so small that when you call UF, you have to look at them very closely. 5. Mostly app shows you that milage are shorter than its actually are. They probably calculate with small car routes. 5. It could be nice ...."
2019-10-14 02:21:08,5,Easy Easy Easy
2019-10-10 05:02:01,1,You can't book loads until 4 hours after delivery
2019-10-09 20:45:43,5,Amazing
2019-10-06 11:21:24,5,"ontime payiment, nice popele"
2019-10-04 18:10:36,3,You Should put again ofert option.
2019-10-04 16:22:05,5,Great app
2019-10-04 13:33:24,5,Good
2019-10-04 13:23:37,3,Good
2019-10-04 10:26:48,5,My favorite
2019-10-03 11:27:40,1,This app is garbage I'm losing money because of this app. This garbage kept open up another vision of the app no matter how many time I uninstalled and reinstalled and signed out and signed back in same thing. Old vision I'm using a Galaxy S10e new phone. I'm still having problems with this dumb app. Im this close to delete this uber freight app and take my services elsewhere? What I really wanna know is who's the clown UPDATED this application.
2019-10-02 19:30:53,2,"They were a kinder Gentler company in the beginning, now they Grown you nothing but a #( carrier ) been haul 2 years for them even received a bonus, now my account suspended forever for being late, no waning was given and they don't give a chance ,no loyalty ."
2019-10-02 13:08:28,4,Can u guys add van/reefer load under reefer only search as well or make it option by it self like van only or reefer only... Thanks
2019-10-02 10:02:52,2,"I call in today need help with my app agent told me only send a link to my phone not an email, then i call in again another man also hes been RUDE this is the most rude representative company I ever seen. Please carrier and trucker don't waist your times with these guys soon or later I am sure you will have problem with them if Management allow employees it's ok to be Rude to truckers"
2019-10-02 00:33:41,1,Doesn't log me in.
2019-09-27 13:41:02,1,Trying to sign up for this app and it says you need more information. It asked me to contact you via phone or email. I tried both and neither work. Not good at all. I hope you fix this
2019-09-26 22:40:30,5,Easy to use.
2019-09-26 16:03:46,1,i booked load from ven nuys ca to visalia ca. when i was on the way to pickup load they sent me email with different timing like i have to pickup after one day. i said how can you send me different timing for pickup without my permission you should call i have different schedule i bounced that load bcos of different timing. email is not solution. and if we ask for any compensation thay told me you bounced that load we can't give you nothing. thy did 2 times with me.
2019-09-26 16:03:39,4,great
2019-09-26 16:02:55,5,Awesome! .keep up the good work..!
2019-09-26 13:25:44,5,"Best app thus far.... Transparent, unlike other brokers and their apps"
2019-09-26 13:20:46,4,"Like the app, needs better rates and a negotiation button. I use all the time. Also would help if i can book a load and assign my other driver to a load. Can only book 1 truck for the day"
2019-09-26 13:15:25,5,Very simple to use.
2019-09-26 13:14:52,5,Very easy to book loads. No phone calls. Gives complete addresses of pick and drop locations before you book load. Quick pay at no charge. Thanks Uber Freight üëè
2019-09-21 17:32:51,1,I can't even install the app for some reason
2019-09-20 01:54:59,1,Probaly the worst app out there. Dirt cheap freight plus they come up with excuses to not pay detention. (Hidden rules)
2019-09-19 18:01:07,1,"Whoever took the information for the load that my company booked with this place is a total moron, wrong information for pickup, phone numbers incorrect!! At least get people that speak English that one can understand when you call them... DO NOT USE THESE MORONS!!!!"
2019-09-18 15:41:38,4,Good
2019-09-18 02:01:10,1,Doesn't work. Requires emailing Uber to signup and they don't respond. I just want to book a freight delivery. It's easier to go through MSC. This app is a joke.
2019-09-17 23:58:00,1,"HORRIBLE COMMUNICATION!!! My account got suspended for no reason. Uber Rep advised that it was due to me and my drivers arrived late to shipper/receiver but, the the last 4 loads we did was a month ago where we DID arrived on time!!"
2019-09-16 18:31:23,1,What happened to this app? How can I install the old version?
2019-09-16 17:40:08,5,awesomeness
2019-09-15 02:39:24,4,Hi i want know if we can use the 26' box truck for uber freight thank you
2019-09-14 01:33:15,1,"You were perfect when you first started, now you put too many stuff on the app and it keeps freezing up, very poor"
2019-09-11 17:47:56,1,Cant open app reset password still wont open
2019-09-10 13:50:12,2,App needs more functionality
2019-09-10 00:06:41,1,"App will not work for me. I login then it says no network error, check that I'm not in airplane mode. Has never worked, have to use website."
2019-09-09 15:11:45,2,"Had no problems with this app at all ..... until latest update!! Running S10 with up to date software and this app constantly says ""lost connection"" even though all other apps requiring connectivity work perfectly. I have to close and reopen app constantly to book any load. Dont update if you are running older version!!"
2019-09-06 18:46:29,5,Excellent
2019-09-06 18:46:22,4,Not bad
2019-09-06 01:04:57,1,This app will not work properly at all.... keeps saying not enough information after you attempt to login and the full page isn't even showing up. You can't scroll or really do Anything because your looking at half a screen. Can't make it past the login page which doesn't even work
2019-08-31 15:05:18,4,"This app is good, but it could be better if it is designed to allow carrier to make offer on every posted load price."
2019-08-29 17:09:23,1,Uber suck
2019-08-29 03:38:00,1,"Can't log in, type in info and password disappears when I hit enter"
2019-08-28 13:19:58,2,"App repeatedly stops loading available loads 'near you' and has to be deleted and reinstalled. Even then it may not load properly. Support has no solution. Now they force a new app that is totally changed from what everyone is used too and worse. All my favorite loads are gone replaced with loads I've never hauled before. Gone is the easy to read contrasting blacks and whites, now it's an all white background with no dark mode option. Just another battery drain on my phone that i don't need."
2019-08-28 12:19:07,5,Wonderful.
2019-08-28 05:13:52,1,Old format was much better. Get it back!!! Please.
2019-08-27 13:10:44,1,It doesnt work
2019-08-23 03:04:34,1,"Trash loads, bad scheduling, no communication with uber brokers and shippers/receivers. These people are clueless... They need to stick with ride sharing, because freight is not there lane!"
2019-08-20 21:16:34,1,Downloaded app 30hrs ago with no access. Maybe this will speed things up.
2019-08-20 20:17:38,1,The pick up/drop off addresses are wrong 90% of the time which results in confusion and cancellations with no TONU! Prices are ridiculous and hurt the market and the drivers. Uber Freight should really take another look at their ethics and train their employees more accurately.
2019-08-20 16:11:28,5,great
2019-08-15 20:33:31,1,garbage freight
2019-08-15 17:18:07,1,"i can't see that any loads are available, please fix problem, i can't work if i can't find freight, is anyone else having problems"
2019-08-15 16:23:49,1,"I tried booking a load with Uber for the first time and it ask to assign the driver and that he had 30 minutes to accept it. since he had not received any information I called their customer service. the first attempt I was waiting for 12 minutes, second attempt took 20 minutes for them to answer & tell me that someone else has booked the load. in total i spent over 40 minutes & resolved nothing, waste of time."
2019-08-14 22:59:49,1,this new update sucks!!!!!!!!. it is more difficult to upload your paperwork sometimes not all my loads show on my appt ever since this app I been backed up on billing all uber loads. this new app always losing connection and is very slow compare to the old version. this new app is more difficult to book loads I can keep going
2019-08-14 22:10:40,2,this new version app is very buggy
2019-08-14 11:57:33,1,it doesn't work at all...the first problem is you don't respond already emailed u...and i can't login while it was activated.
2019-08-13 01:22:37,3,It was good till two days but i don't what happen couldn't see loads from mybcell phone app was try to solve it with custumer service but it wasnot solve it yet
2019-08-12 22:47:34,1,can i get someone on the phone or email to sign up?! its been a week
2019-08-11 23:38:48,5,very good
2019-08-11 19:58:54,1,"I liked the options to watch the loads I am interested in or could make an offer if it wasn't enough..i also liked the old format it also is easier on the eyes..ive noticed the updates to this app ARE not in the interests of the carrier,this is a take or leave it app..ive also been told by it's associates that they can block you from seeing good loads or lanes you already cover..the experiences with there carrier service at times are very difficult and quite condescending.so bware of this be safe"
2019-08-10 13:18:35,2,"On my load option it said no load booked for today or tomorrow. if I go to book load option, it show load already booked when I didn't book any load. this version is worse for driver and dispatcher. üëé"
2019-08-09 16:04:13,5,ok
2019-08-08 15:01:09,5,It's EASY!!
2019-08-08 09:58:10,5,uber freight is exclt
2019-08-07 03:18:10,1,"im really hating this app since they changed it,i think it's terrible,always freezing and not working correctly.i think they should change it back to the way it was,worked great back then."
2019-08-07 01:19:53,4,"wish I had this year's ago. no hassle, dont have to listen to brokers blow smoke, if you like the price book it."
2019-08-06 21:54:14,1,"Its says im booked on days that im not booked, therefore I cant see loads for those days. FIX IT!!!"
2019-08-06 15:02:45,5,love It
2019-08-06 14:44:48,4,good source it keeps up with cuurent rates somewhat
2019-08-05 23:48:54,1,no way to watch loads or bid on them
2019-08-05 13:52:03,5,good
2019-08-05 05:44:29,5,good
2019-08-04 20:47:28,5,"its great app. you can trust and follow the instructions prompted. as a broker Uber is better than all others, easy and graunteed detention is paid. load is paid on 7 days direct deposit to account no deduction"
2019-08-02 23:38:43,5,I just love it
2019-08-02 18:24:49,1,will not load past 69%... I've tried 4 times...
2019-08-01 01:45:03,2,Frequently needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled to function properly. Very frequently! support has been of no help. In fact they will do a bunch of things and try hard to fix. But after a rather lenthy session I was always told to uninstall and reinstall. Almost every week I find it not functioning appropriately and uninstall and reinstall without calling support now. 2 stars because we like to haul for them otherwise would be 1 star! Need a Web version as a backup like most broker boards!
2019-07-31 13:01:31,5,un novel de primer service y exelencia de lo mejor
2019-07-31 10:39:41,3,ok
2019-07-31 09:06:54,5,great
2019-07-31 04:25:52,1,"this app won't let me book no more than one load per day and we have multiple drivers it doesn't make any sense they need to fix this bug I called app support and they can't see anything wrong on their side I uninstalled and reinstalled and still the same problem, I'm listed as dispatcher and driver on the app so I was able to book loads for my other drivers under the older Uber freigh app version. now it shows that I already booked a load for the day and I can't book anything else."
2019-07-31 01:34:55,1,"first day trying to use the app and it says you're already booked for this day, it says this for everyday i try but ive never booked 1 load, cant even see what loads are available because it says you can only book 1 load per day, help would be greatly appreciated ive called the number and they say its not there problem it's the apps problem"
2019-07-30 23:44:17,5,very nice app
2019-07-30 21:40:30,5,Great
2019-07-30 21:14:00,5,quick and easy to search good rates
2019-07-30 20:10:36,5,great
2019-07-30 20:05:18,5,good I in no
2019-07-30 17:03:37,1,"So here's what you getting by working with UF. I have account but when Im trying to login it says dont recongnize email. Well, called and emailed UF support 10+ times and guess they give a S#17? Nooooo, Im ignored for 2 months. Good luck getting ANY support from these morons! update: So for you UF: I emailed your support 10+ times and got ZERO replies."
2019-07-26 21:29:26,5,can i do that with a cargo van?
2019-07-26 21:24:43,1,"This is a race to the bottom for owner operators. they're searching for the lowest bidder. Shippers, cheap trucks usually mean cheap service."
2019-07-26 17:39:27,1,with a new update post truck notification not working. try to uninstall and install many time from yesterday. pls fix this issue
2019-07-24 20:02:20,1,"When submitting paperwork for detention, the app only allows for 1 image, though you are able to submit more pages with your P.O.D. Also, even when you show them that you are at the pickup or delivery on time, they still state that you didn't meet the detention criteria .. easy way to cheat us out of detention pay. Also, rates for anything over 300 miles are so low as to not be worth looking at. They can certainly do better."
2019-07-24 17:59:01,5,ok
2019-07-24 00:42:58,2,The user interface sucks. The colors are bad. I like the older version better than this new one. It's harder for me to post up my truck with the new updates.
2019-07-22 18:14:29,2,"They're okay as a brokerage, but the app is surprisingly bad. Constantly having to uninstall and reinstall because it crashes all the time. Functionality is terrible. If you happen to pull reefer and you want to look through dry loads, you literally have to sift through all their dry loads to see which ones allow reefer trailers because they don't program in a way to sort out van only loads. Clearly rushed to the market with a lack of input from trucking professionals."
2019-07-21 01:54:41,5,good
2019-07-19 16:51:07,5,good app
2019-07-18 20:20:13,5,great way to get your truck loaded.
2019-07-17 23:10:35,1,"i have been working with them for almost an year now. rates are decent customer service is good. however, ifyou run into an issue....god speed. nobody is able to help you. customer service takes the call, they emphatize with you...solution? just forget about it. are you on the way to the pick up? they will call u almost every hour(even though the app updates your location) but when it comes to resolving an issue....nobody is to be found. i can give you at least 10 examples...not enough space here"
2019-07-17 19:40:00,1,the most garbage app out here..
2019-07-16 16:17:27,1,"tried it repeatedly, doesn't work"
2019-07-16 06:59:01,1,i can't seem to log in stock at call or email won't let me call i have emailed them several times and have gotten no response.
2019-07-14 08:56:54,2,"New update is bad bad bad. I repeat--bad. You can only book ONE load a day and if it's an overnight load spanning two days, it will say ""Load Already Booked"" for both days. So you can only do one load for two days. Needs to be fixed before it is thrown on drivers like this. I have ran over 150 loads for Uber Freight in the past but this is making me want to quit them all together."
2019-07-10 22:30:13,1,i hate the new look of the app..
2019-07-10 18:00:09,1,"app dose not work on my phone. Always asking for network connect. All other apps working properly. Uninstall and reinstall, still doing same thing. Fed up with App."
2019-07-09 16:33:59,1,not being able to switch from my old company to my new one it's taken 3 months still not fixed
2019-07-09 03:06:52,1,"claims my uber account is disabled when i can login to Uber, Uber Driver, and Uber Easts without issue. the uber freight website then claims i have to make a new account AFTER i successfully sign in because there is already an account using my email? makes no sense."
2019-07-03 13:06:11,1,"very poor service, almost scammers"
2019-07-03 01:33:10,1,watch out whit this people I have twice booked a load whit them and arrive to the shipper and the load was already pu by another carrier.
2019-07-02 05:55:16,1,"I booked my load on uber app when driver arrived for pickup ..shipper don't have load,I called uber they say they will call me back but don't know how long it will take.Very bad experience with this uber freight, hope I could have read reviews before booking load."
2019-07-02 03:04:12,2,I did over 50 loads and love everything about it except for customer service only one person name Richard is wort person to talk to... he helped me few times and always had problem. asked for his supervisor and said he is the boss. can Uber please train their customers service ppl when we ask for lumper fee. thank you
2019-07-01 16:26:47,4,it's not the best at times ... but they well get you there.üëç
2019-06-28 13:03:50,1,The way they handle problems is an absolute joke. Should you run into a problem like a wrong pick up number or wrong adress prepare to loose up to 12 hours of your time before they will be able to solve your problem. because the only people that can are account managers and they only available from 8am-5pm. The 24 hours call center can't help you much. They do listen to you and update the system and tell you that they will call you but THEY NEVER DO ! I had 3 TONU in a single week. 24+hours lost
2019-06-28 02:32:00,1,terrible
2019-06-26 02:01:23,5,in starting uber FREIGHT was very good. So many loads but now going down day by day.
2019-06-24 16:35:37,5,good
2019-06-21 15:58:40,1,crazy
2019-06-21 00:07:44,5,"easy to use, fast payment ,no charge"
2019-06-20 14:22:12,1,that broaker don't have account payment department. you call not body can said nothing to you. every time you call the said someone going to call not body call..att. pena transport LLC
2019-06-18 23:24:45,1,rubbish need alot of fine tuning service and provider
2019-06-18 13:30:47,1,will not accept my password waste of time
2019-06-15 10:20:26,1,"The app is great. Reason for the 1 star is because the rates are below average and and when you need assistance, is like a bunch of different kids answer the phone every time you call. If you ask for a supervisor they say they can't transfer calls. I waited for 2 hrs to get a TONU approved so I could leave the shipper. It kinda makes me feel like they are stalling to get me frustrated and leave without compensation. NO NEED FOR AN AUTOMATED RESPONSE."
2019-06-14 14:33:41,2,"wont let me log in , i have an accout click the sign in it to my email and password I need to put a new email and password because my email passes already taken , im trying to log in not sign up üò†"
2019-06-13 19:55:13,5,good
2019-06-10 17:34:23,1,dis company is sox
2019-06-04 15:50:34,1,not working properly
2019-06-04 08:51:46,1,Went to use this and it wouldn't accept my email. What a way to start a relationship. going back to Uship.
2019-06-04 01:11:09,1,won't open
2019-06-03 03:37:29,1,"uber is a scam stop hauling cheap freight.and make somebody taking advantage of your life,they call it smart way to find idiot driver i call it abuse."
2019-06-01 02:32:06,2,this app give me hard time I can not change my password. when I try to contact uber no body is Abel to help me.
2019-05-31 11:49:23,5,they changed the way to do business. they put more money to the drivers pockets
2019-05-31 11:39:10,1,I dont have same phone number I forgot my password need help
2019-05-30 23:32:37,1,will not let me log in. endless login loop on galaxy s9
2019-05-29 21:13:20,1,experience was horrible never had an account with them but my phone number they recognized but my email they don't. all I want to do is start an account with you guys but your app is too stupid to let me
2019-05-29 11:37:22,3,where is horizontally positions????
2019-05-23 18:45:29,2,do u have to have CDL
2019-05-23 01:11:49,4,nice
2019-05-22 12:44:38,1,it would not let me log in cuz iam an uber driver. it says I need to enter a new phone and email. I have only one phone number.
2019-05-21 10:47:48,1,"i have signed up and downloaded this app ony Android phone but when i enter my ID and password it's given me error, ""No Network Connection"" i uninstalled the app and reinstalled but still not working.."
2019-05-17 21:32:59,1,loads pay below low
2019-05-16 13:15:54,4,Great company to work with! Quick pay with no fees. Only issue is when you put in a search parameter it does not show you the closest loads first. You have to scroll through and look at all the loads.
2019-05-10 21:36:03,1,app got Frozen even the load is been delivered you can't upload paperwork sometimes and also make you look that you are late to appointment and deliver
2019-05-10 12:11:31,1,Uber has cheap freight and does not care about their carriers. Very disrespectful
2019-05-07 03:53:03,5,just love how to book a load.
2019-05-06 19:47:30,1,I would never do business with these people tried telling me my DOT number is not active after I just told them I spoke to FMCSA and they told me it was. Then when I told then to delete my info they hung up on me.
2019-05-06 17:06:08,2,"seems like they would put the ability to update the status of a load in the app... enroute to shipper, arrived at shipper, loaded and enroute to receiver, arrived at receiver, unloaded.. etc. but what do I know? I'm just a truck driver."
2019-04-27 00:33:50,1,"very low rates, I just can't believe they're posting loads for a dollar per mile."
2019-04-23 17:41:21,5,like it
2019-04-22 13:47:24,2,"easy to book loads, but no ability to negotiate price. need some way to put offers on carriers side. prices not good in most cases. to many short loads, with very low rate. miles shown is not road miles but air miles."
2019-04-20 21:18:05,5,be fair to drivers & you will win.
2019-04-19 12:40:07,1,cheap freight
2019-04-19 06:59:06,1,it says no results found when i search by location. it only shows the loads they want me to see. and very cheap.
2019-04-18 15:55:12,5,super And Easy
2019-04-16 22:23:39,1,There needs to be the ability to bid on loads. We dont have time to be making 10 phone calls a day. we should be able to bid on a load and see what bids have been made already. Also as much of the information on the shipper and receiver should be seen. Make this more driver friendly not Broker friendly. 1 star.
2019-04-15 08:33:38,1,"app is not working as before.have to constant watch board.not getting notifications. called 3 staffs told me 3 different things.problem still not fixed.rates changes a lot,some carriers have watch list,it seems as though the location is backwards ,hard to get answers."
2019-04-12 20:50:55,3,"App will not show loads, match not found message. It'll tell me loads are there and show when I press the heart"
2019-04-08 16:21:17,1,Nothing but problems out of this app
2019-04-05 12:28:49,1,"they give you 5 shipping options but then after sign up say ""yeah we really only have the first two. and it has to be full load"" waste of time"
2019-04-04 15:48:27,5,simple and reliable
2019-04-04 15:32:52,5,Easy way to book loads.
2019-04-04 15:29:40,1,you have the heaviest load there is and on top of that you want to look at around 100miles around and it gaves loads 250 miles away some times is a waist of time
2019-04-04 15:11:04,1,the rates suck and you cannot negotiate
2019-04-04 15:09:18,3,you don't have load from Los Angeles to Phoenix AZ
2019-03-30 12:48:21,4,I have an Uber Driver account and the phone number is on that account. I tried to make an Uber freight account and it seems like I cannot use the same account with Uber Freight. Why not??? I only have one phone number. And I have my CDL as well. What? You can't do both unless you have two emails and two phone numbers?
2019-03-29 14:02:14,1,so.e have tools to put offer on load others don't have it
2019-03-28 14:37:42,1,Uber monopolized the truck market now great. This is an app where carriers can get booked on cheap freight with no option for negotiation. I guess Uber is trying to be the #1 worst broker.
2019-03-28 14:35:34,2,"board doesnt show loads for current day olso the next day to,says post ur truck for each day but main board doesnt show loads near by"
2019-03-27 21:25:27,1,near me is not 250 plus miles away from me.
2019-03-27 20:20:12,3,The new update is that for all drivers or only a select group?
2019-03-27 19:19:48,2,"Every update I have to uninstall and reinstall the app. It shows runs no where near your location if you pulled a similar load out of there before loads available near you. The volume of freight declined significantly. Also, now it is asking for me to turn on my location. It is already on...."
2019-03-26 16:38:10,3,Need to update so u can have a bid buttin instead of calling in placing a bid on them low prices
2019-03-24 18:56:44,4,the app works great except when it tells you theres loads available and wont show them to you. I've had to remove and re download a couple time to fix this. if you expect to get your detention when you first submit your invoice... think again they short paid my factoring company saying it wasnt authorized yet when we recieved a new rate con after authorization. when appointment changes need to be made then it can turn into a nightmare. getting better. good company.
2019-03-24 15:39:50,1,$90 for 50 miles trip. why do these companies love to see us starve?
2019-03-23 07:54:40,5,thankyou
2019-03-19 15:55:46,5,very easy to work with!
2019-03-18 15:10:28,3,why do some get the option to bid and the one I have doesn't even of I download beta or not
2019-03-16 20:59:52,2,Makes no sense that I have to create a whole new email account just to sign up
2019-03-14 10:48:17,5,its a great
2019-03-09 20:49:18,5,eady to work with . very detailed on the loads im happy with it
2019-03-09 11:56:54,3,"The support staff are very good. My assigned staff/broker is very good. The app also very good; easy to use, all the info and map. The only issue is pricing. You get a load with good price but next time you see the same load it has a price reduction and everyday after it's less and less. You'll see two loads going to same place, even same appointment and a difference in price. They say it's the software that prices but no one bothers to correct issue. If it wasn't for that it would be a 5 star"
2019-03-08 15:25:40,1,Won't let me log in. Changed password because it said it was wrong and it wasn't.
2019-03-08 06:57:15,4,improving
2019-03-08 05:11:57,1,"man this app sucks, that's all. no other comment. can't log in what ever i do, support has been lazy and not worth it. whatever"
2019-03-05 19:16:55,2,I'm not logging into de app
2019-03-05 17:54:22,1,"Can't log on at all. Account reset is not an option. Has my phone number tethered to some email I dont know. Called for help, got voice mail. Good luck starting out in limbo."
2019-03-03 03:20:48,5,"Freemarket at its best, pay is very low but it's better than empty miles. Gets me home also. I also cancelled loads without penalties if i find a better paying load."
2019-03-02 07:00:25,4,good
2019-03-02 02:30:41,5,none
2019-02-28 03:12:51,1,won't load
2019-02-27 18:17:35,5,"Very easy to work with uber freight, you can see where is and who is the shipper and receiver, very fast payments. Thank you"
2019-02-26 16:52:13,5,very good
2019-02-24 18:34:23,1,it will not let me login to my account and it keeps sending me to the rider side and not the freight side guess they don't want my business
2019-02-22 19:07:08,1,"Never again. I booked and delivered only one load. It was really cheap, 450 mi for 600$. I was detained at the shipper for 4 h, thats why next morning I called my representative to tell her that I'll be late 30-40 min for 10 am delivery. She said thats ok, and she will notify the receiver. Then she told me that she moved my appointment for NEXT day 6 PM. (Thank you). I was only one hour away. That was my first and last load for them."
2019-02-22 15:18:56,5,So far so good.
2019-02-21 21:13:06,5,this is the future.. nice dispach no truble on canceletion
2019-02-19 05:56:21,5,the best load board!!!
2019-02-18 15:27:56,4,"its a great app...1 problem though, in the app is says near you...it always shows Illionis (chicago area) or Ohio (Columbus, Cincinnati area) I am in Indianapolis, IN . even updated the location an still same."
2019-02-18 03:49:19,4,need to have a negotiation button. you offer a rate I can counter..etc
2019-02-17 17:53:36,5,nice
2019-02-16 23:25:46,1,tried to sign up when i hit submit it would just refresh to the previous screen this app is broken and needs repair your loss not mine
2019-02-16 21:39:53,5,This app made my load searching and booking life so much easier. Rates need to be set for all posting. Nothing below 2.50 per mile. just my opinion. Overall great app!!
2019-02-15 19:55:37,2,"The app is actually one of the better freight apps. the pricing is often low. this is a spot market, yet broker trys to pay standard lane rates. which of course don't apply on p/u freight."
2019-02-15 18:07:54,1,"When the app works it works well, easy to search for and book loads, the support staff is always helpful and easy to reach. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because their system repeatedly changes my account status to intrastate carrier and locks me out of the app until I call and get a human to fix it. I have had this problem for months and 5 times in the last 24 hours. This problem makes the app nearly unusable. Also, need to be able to limit deadhead miles when searching for loads.."
2019-02-15 11:50:16,4,easy peasy
2019-02-14 20:03:33,3,Need to allow cash advancement other than that good stuff Drivers
2019-02-14 19:37:34,4,"The document upload is poor, sometimes won't load."
2019-02-14 18:22:10,1,"since the last update I haven't able to see loads, it's getting annoying now"
2019-02-14 18:17:56,5,wow

2019-02-13 18:16:27,5,no lies no surprises great app
2019-02-13 18:02:05,4,satisfied
2019-02-10 18:30:11,1,Lol this is not a taxi the rate is soooo cheap uber is legal online thief.
2019-02-07 12:48:01,1,can't bid on loads
2019-02-06 22:11:32,2,really hard to get detention time pay
2019-02-01 20:58:34,1,not working as I was an uber driver they won't let me sign in. and the reason I left uber is because as a driver don't feel secure with them any false accusations they end up deactivate your account for a while I don't recommend uber for anyone till they fix this issues of kissing customers asses
2019-01-31 20:37:32,1,doesnt work
2019-01-31 05:17:38,5,"SAY NO TO UBER. ALL DIGITAL BROKERS NEED TO GO OUT OF TRUCKING. STOP USING THEM IF YOU WANNA SURVIVE. things changed, uber showing its true face. Bad customer service, they have dropped the rates. they are the cause for damaging trucking industry. they are keeping their profits by harming trucking companies."
2019-01-26 23:37:43,4,So far good. But i would like to see something that would allow me to bid on the load. Vs uber freight just having a fixed rate per load.
2019-01-24 05:57:04,1,I was a partner with them for more them a year and a half ... and then sudenly with no logical explination they deactivated my account for fake incidents reports .this app is fake and false and needs to be deleted for the best of our community's local business standing .. my company will never partner with this kinda of MF fake tech company! your fake engineers are sucks as hell and need to be fired for good !
2019-01-22 21:42:17,1,"i analyzed this ubber freight and notice it has the lowest rates in the market, not good for owner operators or small companies. as a owner oparator i recommend to stay away from them"
2019-01-18 15:51:04,3,"Uber, please keep the rates visible to all- because some horrible brokers WILL rebroker it, after skimming some off the top. And dispatchers will want to hide the rate so they can low ball their drivers."
2019-01-17 13:53:46,1,Someone is using my phone number and I can't Sign up.
2019-01-16 22:18:06,1,The dumb app wont open
2019-01-12 01:09:07,1,it will not let me log in
2019-01-10 19:51:55,1,"Poor response time. Call center can‚Äôt answer questions & have to submit them to an Acct Mgr, responses can take days. Situations take time to explain and it‚Äôs a different person each call which means covering details repeatedly, call center can‚Äôt be on a call for more than 20mins then hang up leaving unresolved service when urgency is key! It‚Äôs shady to train staff to only help for 20mins, Uber blocks contact to Acct Mgr, approval of detention/overlays can take weeks in hopes you forget about it"
2019-01-01 17:35:58,3,I like the app mainly cause u doint have to talk to a lying aggravating broker except for detention u have to ck in 30min before it starts. I thought that is what the app was for was to track ur in an out times. so now uber is denying my detention request cause I didn't ck in even though the shipper gave me a in an out that matched the apps times.
2018-12-28 06:53:40,5,"I actually like love thus app(uber) I'm grateful, Ive been able to support my family, Company, and save a little extra...cant beat that...Thank you Uber!!!"
2018-12-28 00:48:14,1,Why there is no section Cargo Van
2018-12-26 20:07:07,3,you should let us upload the insurance certificate through the app.
2018-12-21 17:46:40,4,need to be able to bid on load what you got load posted as is what it goes for should be able to negociate
2018-12-21 15:24:30,1,Open operations in Mexico in 2017 but dont support a Mexican based company. Just unbealivable and maybe not legal. You cannot require DOT or MC to companies operate outside of US. I just going to contact tge media how publish the operations start news to ask if they know that? after give for free lots of marketing expose for non Mexican Companies
2018-12-21 12:38:34,4,they dont pay enough but then none of these companies pay us like we need to be paid these are facts
2018-12-20 20:23:53,5,good app
2018-12-19 01:50:59,1,"not good keep saying no load, better fix it for more truckers"
2018-12-18 15:14:17,1,"well it used to be a lot of loads,but now its always saying no loads available regardless of where my Location is. so seems like uber freight is falling off"
2018-12-18 04:24:17,1,I used all the functions within the app and provided phone support with all the details of a bad pickup number and was denied detention time when it took 5 1/2 hours to pick up 5 pallets and the error was on Uber Freights end. They took no responsibility and I had to wait until 9am eastern for account managers to begin their day before they would provide assistance. That still took 2 hours. I arrived at 7:30 for an 8am pick up and wasn't loaded until 12:15.
2018-12-17 22:49:08,2,Apps don't work we have to email POD and delays payments very inconvenient for the user to call and check for the status of payment...
2018-12-16 03:13:59,1,Just another program for big rig freight jockeys Typical of uber though
2018-12-13 15:52:57,3,Good app. Good rates. Need a way to set deadhead mileage limit
2018-12-12 03:17:42,1,I drive a truck. I dont have time to be messing with an app that don't work right. It dont register when i arrive at a shipper or consignee there always sending disturbing texts when im trying to navigate through traffic asking what my status is.... Hey uber we drive trucks. Chill on the text messages. Fix your app its total junk!!
2018-12-10 23:50:42,1,"Every couple of months, I get error messages with the app...I uninstall, reinstall, and try again, but I keep getting errors...This is holding me a from booking freight. Waste of time."
2018-12-09 13:11:29,3,Too frequently needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled to be able to see loads available.
2018-12-09 03:55:31,4,Good app. State of the Art. You can book load and reloads in seconds. Customer service or live person not so good. Maybe to discourage drivers to not call and instead use the App more.
2018-12-07 03:38:02,1,Trying to sign in and I can't. Uber send me a load board and I do not see any thing good leaving from El Paso
2018-12-06 02:02:34,1,Another business for Uber to destroy
2018-12-05 13:41:37,4,Helpful
2018-12-03 23:03:24,2,Cant even make an account because I have a uber account and dont have 2 phone's
2018-12-03 14:56:04,5,I recomend this app very ise to use
2018-12-01 21:05:48,2,An error msg appears every time I try to upload it
2018-11-30 16:01:42,2,Do something we can communicate not calling all the time
2018-11-30 15:00:17,1,It sucks
2018-11-26 08:33:11,3,How can I sign up using the same account phone and email I use for regular Uber? It won't let me use any of my previous emails associated with Uver either. So basically I can't login or sign up.
2018-11-16 00:34:21,3,I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to update the APP so that now you must select your trailer type over and over and over again but they were wrong...
2018-11-15 01:16:20,5,Do does this work is there a uber freight driver app... Howes this work
2018-11-14 17:02:23,1,Wouldn't let me make my account says it has both my email accounts already
2018-11-13 21:23:41,1,Won't let me to set a password and login
2018-11-09 18:00:58,5,It's great
2018-11-09 13:23:30,1,I think the rates are ridiculous real cheap never seen nothing we're falling if you're hauling for these rates your must be out of your mind
2018-11-09 05:33:14,4,Now ok..!
2018-11-08 20:14:50,1,"Its been useless to me for a long time, it tells me there is an update and I have uninstalled and re-installed several times but for some reason it always puts same version on my phone then it gives me the same message not supporting my version. I just dont have time to fool with it any longer"
2018-11-06 14:56:24,1,Set up is horrible
2018-11-03 21:28:54,4,I think this is a cool app! It's convenient and it's easy to use!!
2018-11-01 13:49:29,2,"This app is the center of this Business, therefore, can't let it with bugs. This app is having some serious issues. It needs to be fixed ASAP. This is my advice."
2018-11-01 01:49:02,4,Great app...has some work to do though.
2018-10-29 17:33:59,1,"I dont know but I cant see no load ,alway the app say no load math."
2018-10-29 10:55:51,5,UBER FREIGHT 24 carrier services is great. Always available and helpful
2018-10-28 15:31:16,4,Low rates. Should be able to bid
2018-10-27 14:18:26,3,"Since the new update it will not let you see any loads after you book a load, of the day of pick up or delivery."
2018-10-27 13:24:28,5,The best.. Makes my job easier
2018-10-27 07:32:20,5,Excelent easy and fast payment excelent rstes
2018-10-27 01:48:57,5,Great!!!
2018-10-26 22:28:36,5,It's the best ever
2018-10-26 20:07:30,1,The pay schedule is terrible
2018-10-26 18:47:07,4,Would like to be able to customize recommendations. Don't need to see loads from areas I am not in. Recommended loads should be where the vehicle isatatthepresent time not the past.
2018-10-26 16:15:27,5,"Easy, fast payment üëç"
2018-10-26 15:48:04,5,The Uber Freight app works great
2018-10-26 15:39:43,4,The app is stable and has enough details to get the job done.
2018-10-26 15:36:33,5,This app is great i hope they add a detention button. That's all.
2018-10-26 15:35:35,5,Very easy to use app.
2018-10-26 15:29:57,3,The app is okay. Would like to see more reefer loads.
2018-10-26 15:15:11,5,Good job very happy with the app And teamwork Now we have to work on better rates and we have a 100% satisfaction
2018-10-26 15:12:38,4,Work's well.
2018-10-26 15:04:08,3,"Rates are always to low, never able to talk with anyone about the rates. When I do receive a call load is already booked"
2018-10-26 14:57:04,2,it's so much harder to find loads. it was easier before
2018-10-26 14:44:57,5,It is easy to use.... thumps up...
2018-10-26 14:40:30,5,The app is great thank you
2018-10-26 14:38:50,3,"The app is good,only thing you need to add is ""Bid option""."
2018-10-26 14:33:29,3,Was good when I first started. Now sucks like rest. Uber not a fair company to the owner operator. Your time and efforts means nothing to Uber. Never call you back. As you see on reviews they only respond to good reviews. If you continue as you are you won't have to worry about dealing with trucks for long. They have to be loosing freight with the way they play with rates. Loads can't be getting picked up. Moving away from being a carrier for Uber.....
2018-10-26 14:33:28,5,"Very nice, I love it"
2018-10-26 14:32:55,3,Great app only missing bid option would give 5 star if i was able to bid on loads
2018-10-26 14:32:41,5,Pay more
2018-10-26 14:25:51,4,Good app
2018-10-26 14:25:16,5,absolutely wonderful
2018-10-26 14:24:33,5,"Great rates, great support."
2018-10-26 14:22:32,4,I like your jgles
2018-10-26 14:14:22,3,"App is fine, not many refrigerated loads (hence the 3 stars)"
2018-10-26 14:13:51,5,Great app and company
2018-10-26 14:12:25,5,Great
2018-10-26 14:10:07,3,"App is getting better but still far from been good. It would be helpful if you can add bid option, also if you allow to choose range from location you are serching from. And If you can add option to eather add some loads to favorite list or at least remove some loads from showing up if you have no interest in them. Prices on the load board went down lately but some times you can still get decent price on some."
2018-10-26 14:04:51,2,It would be good if we could bid on loads
2018-10-26 14:04:39,5,"Nice app to book loads, and quick upload BOLs after delivery"
2018-10-26 14:04:38,5,"This is a app easy to work with, I love it."
2018-10-25 16:34:35,2,"Simple interface, but no way to search specific lanes nor set a home location. When I set app I was in GA and it thinks I live there, no settings access to change it nor set up weight parameters."
2018-10-24 23:12:38,5,Highly advance Trucking business App with sufficient tools and room for improvement.
2018-10-23 21:53:19,5,Greatest
2018-10-19 06:09:38,5,Best App.
2018-10-16 09:46:02,5,Very good
2018-10-15 18:13:10,5,Rates depend on the market you are in. Fast paying most of the time i can depend on uber freight to get me out of slow area
2018-10-15 18:03:15,5,Keep up the good work... Thanks
2018-10-15 14:51:09,1,Can't log in and can't reset password with provided email link. Uber acknowledges that I have an account.
2018-10-12 19:31:29,1,"Will never use UberFreight booked a load with Matt Zeeman and Tom Kowlaski, when got to pick up they cancelled and never paid TONU"
2018-10-11 16:06:17,5,Uber Freight is years ahead of the game.
2018-10-04 22:10:07,1,Insulting cheap freight.
2018-09-27 20:41:20,2,There is no option to bid. You can only instantly book the loads. If you want different rate you have to contact.
2018-09-26 18:03:16,3,O.k. thanks
2018-09-26 13:36:42,3,that last updated is bad!! I have to change my search setting and trailer type everytime I'm looking for a load!!
2018-09-24 09:54:45,1,"Heavy loads and cheap. Using chrobinson lately, same rates but have a lot of light loads to choose from"
2018-09-21 04:25:41,4,Good work
2018-09-17 03:20:03,1,It freezes up to old locations
2018-09-11 03:48:08,1,You suck
2018-08-30 16:03:06,1,"App sux, cheap loads..enough said"
2018-08-27 05:47:21,1,I think it's a shame that you cannot get no support after 5 in the afternoon when you are trying to book a load I think this is a horrible horrible app that y'all need to completely go back and redo
2018-08-26 12:12:14,1,"They have some of the heaviest freight available. 45,000lbs plus"
2018-08-23 07:07:51,4,I think it should have a negotiation capability
2018-08-23 02:27:52,5,"Great app, very good and handy for my business."
2018-08-22 23:58:19,5,The best app
2018-08-10 01:18:09,2,"They are scammers , they will pay you more sometimes until they get you 
bait. When you bait they will use lots of tricks to control you in very 
rude and arrogant manner. Detention is paid but my gross is less, because 
more loads give more money not waisted day in detention."
2018-07-30 19:11:29,5,The best
2018-07-21 18:19:00,4,"Pretty Good freight, remember the shippers and receivers are slow Uber is 
just the broker, give them a chance. Im enjoying it."
2018-07-21 04:03:50,1,"First time using it. They are a bunch of tech people that know nothing 
about freight (everyone starts somewhere) everything is slow. Always ""ok 
I'll send it over and we might let you know"" I've been sitting on a load 
that was rejected because I the union receiver said ""I wasnt hired to do 
manual labor"". 3 pallets tipped and he rejected the load of water. Nothing 
wrong just needs restacked. I have now been sitting for 12 hours waiting on 
uber to decide what they want to do with the load. I call every 30mins to 
ask your. And same thing ""we sent it waiting""...I wont waste my time ever 
again. End up being sick up here all weekend Losing money"
2018-07-14 14:58:38,1,Doesn't work for box trucks gvwr 10000-12000 lbs
2018-07-10 07:14:15,1,Hell no don't waste your time .you gonna loose a lot.
2018-07-02 03:44:51,1,"Want to work free or for pennies then this is your app only low lifes that 
have no business use this!"
2018-06-26 19:15:58,4,"I go to the same places CH Robinson (CH Sarvation) sent me but Uber pays 
more, in some cases a lot more. They have also made good on the detention 
so far. The app is still a little buggy and we need to override the GPS as 
the pin is located at the front door, not the loading dock. I'm making 
money so I don't have any complaints, but we will see if they can keep it 
up."
2018-06-21 14:40:34,4,"Like the app. Suggestion....... Instead of taking a picture of the bol's 
Why can't we upload a PDF?"
2018-06-20 18:18:04,1,Dont waste your time. You cant get paid. I want my money uber.
2018-06-16 20:05:23,5,"Amazing, this will weed out those brokers who profit on nothing and under 
pay the carriers!"
2018-06-14 05:10:52,1,"Dont sign up unless you are dumb enough to except cheap pay and slavery!!! 
They are the worst!!! They pay like you are driving a freaking car not a 
semi truck that actually requires hard work... uber been a scam and will 
stay a scam."
2018-06-08 15:06:35,5,I think this app is cool
2018-06-05 22:20:40,1,"Looks like they pay the same as Uber x. But if I have air conditioning in 
the van and leather seats in the truck will they pay more?"
2018-05-21 03:29:32,4,Had no problems so far good customer service and easy to use
2018-05-11 12:29:36,3,"For you guys saying that you can't enter your equipment type... you have to 
enter it through your browser on your phone or computer... not through the 
app."
2018-05-11 10:51:33,1,uber is cheap .
2018-05-09 03:48:53,1,Fake company. Don't work with them if u r not a cheap labor
2018-05-05 18:56:26,2,Can not select trailer size. Please fix
2018-05-03 23:51:21,1,"Its like uber X.worthless no money at all if you want to work for free go 
to uber"
2018-05-03 02:01:51,1,Won't let me enter equipment type in setup
2018-04-15 14:55:06,1,"Tried to sign up and won't take any trailer type. I selected them all and 
nothing happened and signup wouldn't complete. Seems like a waste of time 
so it's uninstalled."
2018-04-03 15:09:11,1,Worst Brokrage they never make appointments for deliveries or pickup
2018-04-03 13:13:37,1,Put in all info needed but trailer size and type would not accept it the other thing is there's no way to contact these people for help you go to contacts and it tells you that there is no page for contact you think if they wanted to do business they would put an app on here that actually works
2018-03-28 23:27:47,3,Apps is hangs on sometime.
2018-03-25 14:56:14,3,"Its a good app and idea, You can book a load anytime, anyday. The rate are like CHRob, or TQL. I use this app for last obtion only. Once you setup your account dont let you change what you do, am trying to change the payment meth... and i cant do it by my self, dont let you negociate rates like JBHunt 360. Fix that and you will have more truckers coming..."
2018-03-24 01:15:06,5,Awesome app
2018-03-20 17:38:03,1,This app dont let me enter (select trailer)**&&&%%$$###@##$%%&
2018-03-20 02:25:46,1,Uninstalling. Don't waste your time
2018-03-19 23:24:14,1,Been about 10 days after aproval and can't log in. Waste of time.
2018-03-13 13:38:04,1,Very bad prices on the loads.no its very very bad prices.
2018-02-27 19:03:45,1,Won't let me on at all. Keeps sending me in circles.
2018-02-05 02:26:21,5,Great
2018-01-24 00:48:32,1,The app freezes.  Doesn't work at all!
2018-01-20 22:42:56,1,I own 3 trucks. One that I personally drive. They won't let me sign up it.  Uber only cares about Uber
2018-01-07 16:34:02,1,Cheap
2017-12-14 05:34:15,1,One word-JUNK
2017-12-07 14:27:41,1,Why give a flatbed option if you don't let flatbeds join waist of time worthless
2017-12-04 02:54:30,1,Uber only cares about Uber.
2017-11-30 20:52:55,5,"Great app, I wish it had dead head miles"
2017-11-09 04:08:46,1,Gave a 1 star because I can't even use their service. They need to be more upfront about who can use it so someone like me who hauls flatbed won't waste their time downloading their app.
2017-11-08 15:32:07,1,WELL THE RATES ARE BASED OFF THE IDIOT TRUCK DRIVERS! WHO ONLY KNOW HOW TO DRIVE AND NOT RUN A BUSINESS! 1-3 TRUCK FLEET MAKE UP INDUSTRY  TRYING PAY THE BILLS. SO APPS LIKE THIS ARE GOOD PIMPING TOOLS. RATES ARE LOWER THAN CONVOY AS OF NOW APP WISE CONVOY IS WINNING! HIGER RATES AS OF NOW WILL LEAD THE WAY OTHERWISE DUMB DRIVERS THE RATES ARE BASED OFF  YOUR MATH JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN COOK A GOOD STEAK DON'T MEAN YOU CAN RUN A STAKEHOUSE!
2017-11-08 08:43:04,5,Nice and awesome  setups
2017-11-04 20:17:51,5,I love it
2017-10-29 10:45:04,1,Very bad
2017-10-21 00:29:25,4,I will give you five stars if you had how to add a driver and assign a load
2017-10-16 13:59:39,1,It's a spam
2017-10-12 18:13:43,5,The best one I  have used.
2017-09-28 19:18:20,4,Been getting good paying loads from this app. Uber seems to be more squared away and organized compared to traditional brokers...I get 98% of my loads from Uber now.
2017-09-23 14:37:21,1,Junk
2017-09-13 23:56:03,4,Nice

2017-08-31 03:54:56,3,"When Uber freight activates their MC to become a motor carrier and have all owner operators lease onto them, will the load payments for the independents go down? Thats how it always goes in this industry."
2017-08-21 15:19:29,5,Awesome company awesome innovative people awesome opportunity to be own boss lets kick ass of all motherf*cking transport companies.
2017-08-14 03:37:36,5,This app is great. Don't have to waste time calling brokers. I also use a factoring  company  and they have paid within the 7 days. Wish they would pay sooner  so I would have to use a factoring  company.
2017-08-13 02:32:28,1,I think it's a waste of time i tried signing up and it rejected me
2017-08-12 04:44:55,1,Sucks
2017-07-24 20:24:19,1,Honestly expected more. Low pay and heavy loads (40-45k). I could easily get higher pay using other load boards. Also very little loads available.
2017-07-14 22:10:22,1,Evil company.  They have room full of economists sitting in their office coming up with new ways to screw drivers from every way possible.  They shouldn't be allowed to dominate the market like they did with taxi industry.
2017-07-01 20:08:25,5,Great app Great brokers
2017-06-29 20:46:55,5,Great infomation
2017-06-26 21:54:30,1,"If you liked getting screwed byTQL,  You'll LOVE ‚ù§ pulling for Uber Freight"
2017-06-26 21:40:58,1,You are required to have a sales call before you can use it and the pricing is NOT competitive.
2017-06-21 19:14:16,1,"I signed up for this service and have yet to receive some sort of login or instructions to be able to look for loads, but that's ok because I don't want cheap freight ether way (according to other drivers who've used the app)"
2017-06-20 12:51:10,1,"Very low rates and high percentage, stay away. Ripoff scammers."
2017-06-17 11:17:50,1,"I'm a truck driver and this is the worst load board I ever seen! The rates are low, witch Uber claims the rates would be higher because of low overhead. A little to no loads in the locations I delivered to (NC, GA, SC, VA). These are great states for loads. The app is nice and it stops right there. Don't waste your time."
2017-06-05 20:25:26,1,Scam
2017-06-05 09:18:33,1,Scam
2017-06-03 10:09:47,1,Scam
2017-06-02 23:59:58,1,don't do business through this company. they knowingly and deceitfully will cheat in every way possible.
2017-05-26 11:51:03,5,Is the best this way Vroker s not still more $$$for TRUCKING company
2017-05-26 00:48:01,1,Installed then uninstalled
2017-05-24 23:59:51,1,It's no good if your not a Van.  They only want vans.  Total waste of time
2017-05-21 23:47:29,5,Nice perfet
2017-05-21 10:43:52,5,"For those of you who gave this app 3 stars or less I have some news for you, this app was designed for owner operator truck drivers who posess a Class A commercial driver's license. This application was not designed for people who have regular personal drivers licenses that includes drivers who pick up passengers through the Uber app, drivers who deliver food via Uber Eats, or any other person who does not possess a commercial Class A drivers license in their respective state. Do not brash and specific app for being a specific app this app was designed with the truck driver in mind. So quit complaining!"
2017-05-19 23:55:05,5,I ship 400 loads per year. If love to try this. Let me in :)
2017-05-19 05:48:54,1,Do not trust this company
2017-05-18 18:05:28,2,Very slow download
2017-04-25 13:19:14,5,The only people who would be against this would be cut throat middle man brokers. The end of truck drivers loosing 40%-45% per load is coming to a end! Truckers now you won't have to be torn between if you can afford to get maintenance done on your equipment this week or pay to keep a roof over your families head. Make trucking profitable again for truckers Uber and you will have a VERY long life in this industry! We are rooting for you! ~Truck Drivers
2017-04-23 16:12:15,5,Revolutionary! In love it! Traditional trucking industry professionals need to embrace not hate.
